## 2026-05-05 — M1.3.4 retrospective: predicate hygiene and authority-layer rules

Both Codex P1 catches in M1.3.4 (a-c8 reroll-cost UI authority; b-c7 zero-content event predicate) shared shape: a predicate or computation that looked correct but encoded the wrong invariant. Three principles ratified going forward, load-bearing for M1.5 relic state and any future ruleset-modifying systems:

1. Predicates encode the invariant they name, not a proxy that usually correlates. Verify every event a predicate excludes is genuinely irrelevant to the named intent, not merely zero in the proxy dimension.
2. Consumers do not reimplement sim-side arithmetic. Sim-computed values are read from sim-exported helpers or reducer-derived state, never recomputed consumer-side. Awkward export = sim API gap, not a license to recompute.
3. Closing-pass review explicitly sweeps predicate-vs-name correspondence and authority-layer correctness, especially on cleanup-pass commits where polish-looking code can hide invariant errors.

Codified as `tech-architecture.md § 4.5 — Authority and predicate hygiene`. Enforcement: prompt-time review (master-developer chat) flags predicate/authority surfaces during scoping; Claude Code halts-when-premise-doesn't-match on detected violations; closing-pass review treats violations as halt-gate findings fixed inline.

## 2026-05-04 — M1.3.4b closed (Phaser combat scene + silent-playback fix; second half of the M1.3.4 inflection split)

- **The render-layer swap lands; M1.3.4 closes.** The DOM Portrait + HP-bar tree dissolved out of `combat/CombatOverlay.tsx`; a Phaser scene (`combat/CombatScene.ts`) now owns combat playback against the already-sim-wired bag from M1.3.4a. No new sim integration. No new state surface. The combat chunk grows to absorb Phaser's runtime; main + mobile chunks essentially unchanged. One design-side fix added under halt-gate (silent-playback option 1 + option 2 combined). Trey-confirmed via screenshot review (mount, mid-tick damage burst, combat-end frame, RoundResolution handoff) plus a manual Chrome DevTools mid-tier mobile profile.

- **Phaser scene ratifications** (per `tech-architecture.md` § 2 + `visual-direction.md` § 7):
  1. **One scene only** (`CombatScene`, scene key `'CombatScene'`). Absolute-position canvas overlay parented into the React-owned `<div>`; transparent canvas; bag stays visible behind per `visual-direction.md` § 1 (60%-of-smaller-dim floor). Asset preload runs in `preload()` and only fires after the combat chunk lazy-loads — title-screen / pre-combat parse cost: zero Phaser, zero textures.
  2. **Floater typography:** `Phaser.GameObjects.Text` with `fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif'`, `fontFeatureSettings: 'tnum'`, `resolution: 2`, drop-shadow for legibility against the bag. Glyph cache covers repeat damage values without a bitmap atlas; no BitmapText pipeline (deferred — not justified at graybox scale; see carry-forward 7).
  3. **Easing:** stock `Phaser.Math.Easing.Quartic.Out` is the documented placeholder for the locked `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` from `visual-direction.md` § 7. Visually indistinguishable at the durations used (80ms HP-bar tween, 600ms floater rise, 280ms portrait pulse). Byte-exact bezier match deferred to M2 if a designer flags inconsistency (carry-forward 6).
  4. **SKIP button:** DOM-owned by React (lives in `CombatOverlay.tsx`'s harness, overlaid above the canvas). Keeps keyboard focus + screen-reader semantics intact; calls into `CombatScene.skipToEnd()` which drains all remaining events without playing visuals, snaps HP/state to final, and advances to `RoundResolution`.
  5. **Geometric particles only** (squares, lines, plus signs) drawn via `Graphics → generateTexture` once at preload, in palette colors (`PALETTE.lifeRed` / `PALETTE.rarityUncommon` / `PALETTE.rarityLegendary`). No organic VFX, no sprite atlases.
  6. **HP arithmetic stays sim-authoritative.** The scene reads `remainingHp` / `newHp` directly from each event's payload — never computes locally. Extends the M1.3.4a step-8 ratification ("UI affordability never reimplements game-rule arithmetic") to render-layer HP as well: the rule is now **UI consumes sim-authoritative HP**.

- **Halt-gate journey (full narrative).** Step 4's first-pass test scenario — a round-1 combat against an empty-bag player — appeared to FREEZE the scene for 60 seconds. A diagnostic instrumentation pass (5 log points across `CombatOverlay.tsx` + `CombatScene.ts`: phase transitions, scene-init events, tick-clock state, event flushes, accumulator math) returned conclusive evidence: the Phaser game loop was healthy, the accumulator math was correct, the tick rate was exactly 10/sec, and events were flushing on schedule. The "freeze" was **60 seconds of valid sparse playback** — the round-1 ghost (deterministic from `combat/ghost.ts`) had rolled a passive item (Apple, Healing Herb, Wooden Shield, or Copper Coin) producing 9 events that never moved HP. The combat ran to completion correctly; it just had no visible action. **Design gap, not bug.** The diagnostic logs were stripped as part of the halt-gate-fix commit.

- **Combined silent-playback fix (option 3 = option 1 + option 2).**
  - **Option 1 — silent fast-forward** in `CombatScene.update()`: when `nextEventTick - currentTick > DEAD_TIME_THRESHOLD_TICKS`, snap `currentTick = nextEventTick - LEAD_IN_TICKS`. Constants live at the top of `CombatScene.ts` with `// tunable per telemetry` comments:
    - `DEAD_TIME_THRESHOLD_TICKS = 8` (800ms at 100ms/tick — long enough that visual pause feels intentional, short enough that 60s-tick-cap combats compress to a watchable handful of seconds).
    - `LEAD_IN_TICKS = 2` (200ms preserved before next event so HP-bar tweens + portrait pulses get visible windup).
    - Tunable via `telemetry-plan.md` § 4 if tick-cap-draw rate or sparse-combat playback time surfaces a need.
  - **Option 2 — zero-content fast-skip** in `combat/CombatOverlay.tsx`: when the pre-mounted `CombatResult` has `damageDealt === 0 && damageTaken === 0 && result.outcome === 'draw'`, dispatch `combat_done` directly without ever mounting Phaser. Telemetry call sites (`combat_start`, `combat_end`) still fire on this path so the playback log stays consistent.
  - **Generation-side fix (filter `combat/ghost.ts` round-1 draws to active-effect items) explicitly NOT taken** — folds into M2's wholesale ghost storage rework where the procedural template gets replaced by per-(round, trophy_band) `GhostBuild` records (see carry-forward 13).

- **Test coverage ratifications.**
  - **Test extraction — option A (pure helper).** Tick-advance + auto-end logic extracted into `apps/client/src/combat/tickAdvancer.ts` (pure functions: `advanceCombatTickClock`, `findNextEventTick`; no Phaser dependency). `CombatScene.update()` calls into the helper. Mirrors `packages/sim`'s pure-function pattern. Tests target the helper directly under happy-dom; Phaser scene-level state (e.g., resolved-flag SKIP behavior) is covered transitively rather than directly. **Documented coverage gap:** scene-level SKIP unit-test absent — revisit if SKIP regresses; manual screenshot verification across two halt-gate passes confirms current SKIP behavior. The pure-helper-first pattern becomes a project rule (see architectural rules below).
  - **+13 client tests / +2 client files:** `combat/tickAdvancer.test.ts` (NEW, +12: auto-end exactly-once, fast-forward compression of the failed halt-gate's exact 600-tick fixture, `findNextEventTick` boundary cases), `combat/CombatOverlay.test.tsx` (NEW, +1: zero-content bypass — asserts no canvas testid, `createCombatGame` mock never invoked, DEFEAT/DEALT/TAKEN copy renders, `combat_done` dispatched with zero-content payload).

- **Halt-gate audit pack (post-fix).**
  - **Vitest:** 4 named cases all green (auto onCombatEnd, fast-forward compression vs the exact 600-tick fixture from the failed pass, zero-content bypass, exactly-once auto-fire). SKIP transitively covered via the helper's `reachedEnd` signal.
  - **Bundle audit:** main delta = 0 KB raw vs M1.3.4b post-fix baseline; combat chunk +0.75 KB raw / +0.30 KB gz on rebuild (likely Vite chunk-graph non-determinism on the Phaser bytecode — tracked, not blocking; if drift exceeds ~5 KB across multiple builds it becomes a real signal — carry-forward 12).
  - **Sourcemap audit:** `phaser` exclusively in `CombatOverlay-*.js` (1 source); main + mobile chunks 0 phaser sources. Combat-only sim subgraph (`combat.ts` / `status.ts` / `triggers.ts` / `iteration.ts`) still combat-chunk-only; main's sim imports remain `rng.ts` / `math.ts` / `run/shop.ts`. M1.3.4a's lazy-boundary integrity holds.
  - **60fps p95 manual profile** (Trey, Chrome DevTools, CPU 4× slowdown, iPhone 12 Pro emulation): scene held 60fps; a 12-16s busy region in the trace resolved to DevTools profiling overhead (728ms of 735ms = 99.1%), not real scene work.

- **Bundle delta (vs M1.3.4a close: main 243.10 KB raw / 75.86 KB gz; combat 22.19 KB raw / 7.50 KB gz; mobile 13.92 KB raw / 3.47 KB gz).**
  - **Main chunk:** 242.88 KB raw / 75.80 KB gz — Δ −0.22 KB raw (−0.09%) / −0.06 KB gz (−0.08%). DOM Portrait + HP-bar tree deletion offset the option-2 fast-skip wiring + DragOverlay rotation transform additions; net slightly lighter.
  - **Combat chunk:** 1,505.59 KB raw / 348.69 KB gz — Δ **+1,483.40 KB raw / +341.19 KB gz** (Phaser 3.90.0 cost predicted by `tech-architecture.md` § 10; chunk fetched on-demand at the Continue button press, so first-load for desktop pre-combat users is unaffected).
  - **Mobile chunk:** 14.02 KB raw / 3.49 KB gz — Δ +0.10 KB raw / +0.02 KB gz (DragOverlay rotation transform style additions in `MobileRunScreen.tsx`).
  - Modules: 99 → 103 (+4: CombatScene, tickAdvancer, tickAdvancer.test, CombatOverlay.test).

- **Test counts (with sim baseline correction — option B).**
  - **Workspace post-M1.3.4b: 107 across 20 files** (80 client / 17 files + 27 ui-kit / 3 files). Δ from M1.3.4a: +13 client tests / +2 client files. ui-kit unchanged.
  - **Sim: 466 active + 1 skipped (intentional) / 13 active files + 1 conditional.** The skipped test is the M1.2.5-step-4 fixture-regeneration entry point gated by `describe.runIf(npm_lifecycle_event === 'generate-fixtures')`; it has been part of the suite since 2026-04-30 and was implicit in the M1.3.4a "sim unchanged" shorthand. M1.3.4b introduced no sim-side test changes — the corrected baseline language is the only delta against M1.3.4a's report.
  - **Content: 30 active / 1 file. Unchanged.**
  - **Turbo pipeline: 25/25 tasks green.**

- **Files added** (`apps/client/src/`):
  - `combat/CombatScene.ts` (Phaser scene + `createCombatGame` factory)
  - `combat/tickAdvancer.ts` (pure helper — `advanceCombatTickClock`, `findNextEventTick`)
  - `combat/tickAdvancer.test.ts`
  - `combat/CombatOverlay.test.tsx`

- **Files deleted:** none at the file level. The M1.3.4a inline DOM Portrait + HP-bar function (`function Portrait` at the bottom of `CombatOverlay.tsx`) was removed during the CombatOverlay rewrite — the 3 character-art hex carry-forward sites lived inside that inline function and dissolve with it.

- **Files modified non-trivially:**
  - `apps/client/src/combat/CombatOverlay.tsx` — Phaser mount + lifecycle (mount on phase entry, `game.destroy(true)` on unmount, SKIP button wiring); option-2 zero-content fast-skip (`isZeroContent` check before `useState(phase)` initialization); DOM Portrait + HP-bar tree deleted.
  - `apps/client/src/screens/DesktopRunScreen.tsx` + `apps/client/src/screens/mobile/MobileRunScreen.tsx` — DragOverlay rotation polish (single-transform silhouette using un-rotated `def.w / def.h` + `transform: rotate(rot deg)` on the outer wrapper, see carry-forward closure 23a below).
  - `apps/client/package.json` — added `"phaser": "^3.80.0"` (resolves to 3.90.0 in `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` — Phaser dependency tree.

- **Architectural rules introduced (project-wide carry-forward).**
  1. **UI consumes sim-authoritative HP.** Render layers — DOM or Phaser — never compute HP locally. Always read `remainingHp` / `newHp` from sim's events. Extends the M1.3.4a step-8 rule ("UI affordability never reimplements game-rule arithmetic") to render-layer HP.
  2. **Fast-forward thresholds are tunable consts, not magic numbers.** Any future scene-timing decisions (combat speed, post-event lead-in, etc.) live as named consts at the top of the consuming file with `// tunable per telemetry` comments. `DEAD_TIME_THRESHOLD_TICKS` + `LEAD_IN_TICKS` set the precedent.
  3. **Pure-helper-first for scene logic.** When scene logic is testable as pure math (tick clocks, event scheduling, etc.), extract to a helper. Scene-mock-based tests are a fallback, not a first choice. `tickAdvancer.ts` is the precedent.

### Carry-forwards

  1. **Item-anchored VFX + `BagLayout` handshake** → M1.4 (when `simulateCombat()` replaces canned combat per the M0 roadmap; `tech-architecture.md` § 2 named the handshake but it stays non-load-bearing through M1.3.4b).
  2. **Real character art in portraits** → M2 (placeholder geometric silhouettes carry through M1).
  3. **Real particle sprite sheets** → post-M1 (programmatic textures sufficient for graybox).
  4. **`item_trigger` / `recipe_combine` event VFX** → M1.4 (require item anchoring).
  5. **Music + SFX integration** → post-M2 per `visual-direction.md` § 8 anchor-only language.
  6. **Custom cubic-bezier easing function** → M2 if a designer flags `Quartic.Out` as off.
  7. **BitmapText / pre-rasterized font atlas** → post-M1 if floater spawn rate at high rounds saturates Phaser's glyph cache.
  8. **`>>` fast-forward indicator visual styling** → M2 polish (function works without it; styling is non-load-bearing).
  9. **Telemetry event for "fast-forward triggered"** → if `telemetry-plan.md` § 4 tick-cap draw rate dashboard surfaces a need.
  10. **Configurable per-user playback speed (1× / 2× / 4× toggle)** → M2+.
  11. **SKIP scene-level direct unit test coverage** → revisit if SKIP behavior regresses; helper-level + manual verification sufficient for graybox.
  12. **Combat chunk Vite build non-determinism** (~0.75 KB raw drift between rebuilds of identical tree) → tracked; flag if drift exceeds ~5 KB across multiple builds.
  13. **Generation-side ghost-loadout filter (option 5)** → M2 ghost storage rework wholesale.
  14. **Codex P1 regression test for UI-vs-reducer affordability under non-default rulesets** → M1.5 (carries from M1.3.4a; relic state machinery makes this load-bearing).
  15. **`opponentClassId` field on `RunHistoryEntry`** → M1.5 (carries from M1.3.4a).
  16. **Server-side ghost record (per-(round, trophy_band) `GhostBuild`)** → M2 (carries from M1.3.4a).
  17. **Auto-rearrange hint affordance over AVAILABLE WITH CURRENT ITEMS** → M3 hint-system work (carries from M1.3.4a).
  18. **Per-round trophy schedule + contract modifiers + win-streak multipliers** → M2 (carries from M1.3.4a).
  19. **`RarityGem` for shop rarity dot** → carries from M1.3.2.
  20. **`apps/client/src/index.css` `.glow-*` rgba palette derivatives** → carries from M1.3.2 / M1.3.3.
  21. **Run-end detection (hearts === 0 → eliminated screen)** → M1.5.
  22. **State-driven bag dimensions through pure helpers** → M2.
  23. **Real-device drag-state screenshot capture** → still carried (M1.3.4b's DragOverlay rotation polish landed code-only; visual capture deferred to next sub-phase or whenever real-device session organically surfaces).
  24. **Player portrait dying-state visual feedback** — M1.3.4b's probe confirmed there is **no** progressive HP-curve tint and **no** binary "took damage" flag on the portrait body; the only red signals are the (always-red) HP bar and the one-shot KO flash on `combat_end`. Filed as **acknowledged absence** for M1.4+ design polish (e.g., low-HP threshold tint, hit-flash pulse) if a graybox reviewer requests it. Not load-bearing for M1 graybox.

### Branch hygiene

2 implementation commits (`439ff73`, `8146692`) + 1 DragOverlay polish commit + 1 closing-log commit on `m1.3.4b-phaser-scene`, branched off main (`a2a31f2`). `--no-ff` merge to main once Trey confirms CI green on origin.

### Next

**M1.3.5+** — Trey scopes the next sub-phase split. The M0 milestone roadmap puts the remaining M1 work as:
- **M1.4** — finalize whatever wiring remains around `simulateCombat()` invocation (M1.3.4a's `combat/sim-bridge.combat.ts` already drives playback; M1.4 is mostly item-anchored VFX + the `BagLayout` handshake from carry-forward 1).
- **M1.5** — relic state machinery, class-select screen, run-end detection (hearts === 0 → eliminated), LocalSaveV1 persistence, the M1.3.4a Codex P1 non-default-ruleset regression test.
- **M1.6+** — boss round + content fill to 45 items / 12 recipes / 3 status / 1 boss.

### Codex P1 catch + zero-content predicate fix (commit 5)

- **Codex Review on PR #7 caught a P1 on the closing-pass tree:** the option-2 zero-content fast-skip predicate `damageDealt === 0 && damageTaken === 0 && outcome === 'draw'` matched not just the canonical empty-event stalemate (the M1.3.4b step-4 halt-gate fixture: round-1 empty bag + passive ghost item) but also any **active** combat that netted to zero HP delta on both sides — damage exactly offset by healing across the combat, mutual-burn stalemates, shield-wall stalemates. Those would have skipped Phaser playback entirely despite having real events the player needed to see.

- **Fix:** replaced the net-HP-delta check with an event-content-based predicate. New module-scope const `MEANINGFUL_EVENT_TYPES: ReadonlySet<CombatEvent['type']>` = `{ damage, heal, status_apply, status_tick, item_trigger }`; `hasNoMeaningfulEvents = !result.events.some(e => MEANINGFUL_EVENT_TYPES.has(e.type))`; `isZeroContent = result !== null && hasNoMeaningfulEvents && result.outcome === 'draw'`. The `outcome === 'draw'` guard stays — a non-draw with no meaningful events would be a sim bug worth surfacing rather than silently bypassing. `CombatOverlay.test.tsx` gains a regression case (Case B) for the offset-heal scenario alongside the preserved canonical-bypass case (Case A).

- **Set composition deviations from the original prompt** (documented inline at the const + recorded here for posterity):
  - **`recipe_combine` is intentionally absent** — it is not a member of the `CombatEvent` union (only listed in `combat/CombatScene.ts:337` as a future event type). Including it as a string literal would fail typecheck against `Set<CombatEvent['type']>`. The original prompt's set proposal included it; the fix had to drop it. If `recipe_combine` is added to the `CombatEvent` union in M2's content sweep, add it here too.
  - **`stun_consumed` / `buff_apply` / `buff_remove` are intentionally absent** — the scene currently renders no VFX for them (`combat/CombatScene.ts:337-339`), so mounting Phaser to play one of those alone would re-introduce a "scene appears frozen" version of the original M1.3.4b halt-gate. Add them here once their VFX lands (M1.4+ alongside the item-anchored VFX work from carry-forward 1).

- **Architectural rule reinforced + documented inline at the const block:** _UI fast-skip predicates check event CONTENT, not net-state deltas._ State deltas are derived; events are authoritative. Future skip / fast-forward decisions inherit this rule. Adds to the M1.3.4b architectural-rules set as rule **4**.

- **Updated stats:** workspace test count **108 across 20 files** (was 107/20 — +1 from the Case B regression test). Sim 466 active + 1 skipped intentional / 13 + 1 unchanged. Content 30 / 1 unchanged. Turbo pipeline 25/25 green. Bundle delta vs the M1.3.4b closing-log baseline at commit `04a335d`:
  - **main:** 242.88 / 75.81 KB gz — Δ 0 raw / +0.01 KB gz (chunk-graph noise per carry-forward 12; predicate logic lives in the combat chunk, not main).
  - **combat:** 1505.59 → 1505.70 KB raw (+0.11 KB) / 348.69 → 348.74 KB gz (+0.05 KB) — Set + comment block + predicate land in the combat chunk per the lazy-boundary discipline.
  - **mobile:** 14.02 / 3.49 KB gz — unchanged.

- **Sourcemap audit re-confirms post-hotfix chunk integrity unchanged.** No new sim modules cross the lazy boundary. `phaser` still combat-chunk-exclusive (1 source in `CombatOverlay-*.js`, 0 in main, 0 in `MobileRunScreen-*.js`); combat-only sim subgraph (`combat.ts` / `status.ts` / `triggers.ts` / `iteration.ts`) still combat-chunk-only; main's sim imports remain `rng.ts` / `math.ts` / `run/shop.ts`.

- **Updated branch hygiene:** 2 implementation commits (`439ff73`, `8146692`) + 1 DragOverlay polish commit (`9b88ab8`) + 1 closing-log commit (`04a335d`) + 1 P1 hotfix commit + 1 closing-log amendment commit on `m1.3.4b-phaser-scene`. Branch force-pushed (`--force-with-lease`) to origin after the hotfix lands so PR #7 re-runs CI against the corrected tree. `--no-ff` merge to main once Trey confirms CI re-run is green on origin.

## 2026-05-02 — M1.3.4a closed (sim wire-up + data.local dissolution; first half of the M1.3.4 inflection split)

- **The inflection point lands.** `data.local.ts` is gone; `packages/sim` integrates into the client through two lazy-boundary-aware bridge modules; the canned 4-second combat SCRIPT is replaced by deterministic playback of real `CombatResult` events; the mobile [Crafting] tab gains its scouted-recipes section. The game stops being a UI demo and starts being a deterministic real game. Trey-confirmed via screenshot review in chat (3 screenshots + re-screenshot pass after blocker fixes).

- **Phasing — M1.3.4a vs M1.3.4b.** The original M1.3.4 scope (sim integration + Phaser combat overlay) was **ratified split into halves in chat before the M1.3.4a prompt was issued.** M1.3.4a (this close) lands sim integration + dissolution + DOM combat playback, letting the sim path stand alone and ratify cleanly. M1.3.4b (next) replaces the DOM portraits / HP-bars with the Phaser combat scene against the already-sim-wired bag — purely a render-layer swap, no new state surfaces.

- **Sim integration ratifications:**
  1. **Single integration surface, split by lazy-boundary.** All client → `@packbreaker/sim` calls flow through one of two bridge modules: `apps/client/src/run/sim-bridge.ts` (shop + run-RNG, main-chunk consumers) and `apps/client/src/combat/sim-bridge.combat.ts` (combat resolver, combat-chunk consumer). Neither bridge imports the other; the split exists to keep `simulateCombat`'s static-import edge inside the lazy boundary. Direct sim imports from feature code are forbidden (one place per chunk to install adapters at the boundary).
  2. **`ItemId` broadens from the M0 narrow 12-slug union to the canonical content brand** (`Brand<string, 'ItemId'>` — re-exported from `@packbreaker/content` via `apps/client/src/run/types.ts`). Sim-generated shop slots can now be any of the 45 canonical items; the iconned-coherence constraint is preserved by filtering the **shop pool** at the bridge (`SHOP_POOL_ITEMS` = 12 iconned slugs), not the type. Drop the filter when icon-art expansion lands the full 45-item set (post-M1.3.4b per `visual-direction.md` § 14).
  3. **Reroll determinism.** `ShopController.generateShop` derives a per-(round, rerollCount) seed via `shopSeedFor(baseSeed, round, rerollCount)` with stride `SHOP_REROLL_STRIDE = 65521` (largest 16-bit prime). Reroll-counter sequences across adjacent rounds stay disjoint up to ~65k rerolls per round. Reroll cost flows through sim's `computeRerollCost(rerollsThisRound, rerollCostStart, rerollCostIncrement, extraRerollsPerRound)`; `extraRerollsPerRound` is hardcoded 0 until relic state machinery lands in M1.5.
  4. **Run-state factory pattern.** `INITIAL_CLIENT_STATE` was a static const in M0; M1.3.4a introduces `createInitialState()` because round-1 shop is sim-generated against a fresh wall-clock `SimSeed`. The companion module-const calls the factory once at import time so tests still observe a stable round-1 state without each test re-running the factory.
  5. **+18 trophy on win is an M0-placeholder value carried into M1.3.4a unchanged.** The real per-round trophy schedule (loss penalties, contract modifiers, win-streak multipliers) lands with M2 trophy-curve work. Until then, win → +18 / loss → +0 keeps the HUD's trophy counter incrementing predictably for screenshot review.

- **Data.local.ts dissolution — 5 distributed concerns:**
  - **Types** → `apps/client/src/run/types.ts` (`BagItem`, `ShopSlot`, `ItemDef`, `Recipe`, `RecipeMatch`, `RunState`; re-exports canonical `ItemId`).
  - **ITEMS / RECIPES adapter** → `apps/client/src/run/content.ts` (45 canonical items adapted to `ItemDef`; recipes filtered to the 4 whose I/O is fully iconned; `SHOP_POOL_ITEMS` = 12 iconned slugs for the sim shop pool).
  - **Layout helpers** (`cellsOf`, `dimsOf`) → `apps/client/src/bag/layout.ts`. `BAG_COLS` / `BAG_ROWS` derived from `DEFAULT_RULESET.bagDimensions` (state-driven dims through pure helpers is M2 work when contract mutators rewrite bag size).
  - **Initial-state seed** → `RunController.createInitialState()` (round 1 fresh start: empty bag, sim-generated shop, gold = ruleset.baseGoldPerRound = 4, hearts = 3, history = []).
  - **`RecipeMatch` type** → `run/types.ts` (moved from `run/recipes.ts` to break the `bag/layout` ⇄ `run/recipes` import cycle that arose when `cellsOf` moved).
  - `data.local.ts` + `data.local.test.ts` deleted; zero `data.local` imports remain.
  - **Intended player-facing divergence:** the prototype's `SEED_BAG` pre-placed mock items at "round 4" so the demo opened mid-run with a populated bag for visual review. Post-M1.3.4a runs start at round 1 with an empty bag (reflecting real game state — the player buys their first items from the round-1 shop). This is not a regression; it's the dissolution of a graybox crutch. The demo experience now matches the actual M1 game flow.

- **Lazy-load combat module per `tech-architecture.md` § 10.** Following the M1.3.3 mobile-chunk precedent, `combat/CombatOverlay.tsx` loads on first combat via `combat/LazyCombatOverlay.tsx` (`React.lazy` + `<Suspense fallback>` at the orchestrator level). The reducer doesn't import `combat/ghost.ts` (which would cross the lazy boundary) — `CombatOverlay` pre-computes `damageDealt` / `damageTaken` / `opponentGhostId` against `initialPlayerHp` / `initialGhostHp` − `result.finalHp`, then forwards a `CombatDonePayload` to `combat_done`.
  - **Lazy-boundary integrity:** Vite sourcemap audit confirms the combat-only sim subgraph (`combat.ts`, `status.ts`, `triggers.ts`) ships exclusively in the combat chunk. Main chunk's sim imports are limited to shop-side modules (`rng.ts`, `iteration.ts`, `math.ts`, `run/shop.ts`). Title-screen and pre-combat users do not parse combat code. Achieved via `sim-bridge.ts` (shop-side) + `sim-bridge.combat.ts` (combat-side) split — the static-import edge from `simulateCombat` originates only in modules the combat chunk consumes.

- **Combat playback (DOM, transitional).** `CombatOverlay` schedules at `TICKS_PER_SECOND = 10` (100ms / tick). For each tick step, damage / heal / status_tick / combat_end events at that tick materialize as floaters; HP bars derive from each event's `remainingHp` / `newHp` (sim's authoritative value) so displayed HP at `currentTick > endedAtTick` equals `result.finalHp` exactly. SKIP button (bottom-right of stage) snaps `currentTick` past `endedAtTick + 2` and advances directly to `<RoundResolution>`. Phaser combat scene replaces the DOM portraits + HP-bar layout in M1.3.4b.

- **Procedural ghost template (`combat/ghost.ts`).** Pure function; inputs `(baseSeed, round, bagDimensions)` → `GhostTemplate`. Class alternates by round parity (odd → marauder, even → tinker — deliberate affinity-mix so combat dynamics differ round-to-round). Item count scales 1 → 5 with round per `ITEM_COUNT_BY_ROUND`. Rarity-gate follows `RARITY_GATE_BY_ROUND`. Items drawn from `SHOP_POOL_ITEMS` so the build stays in the iconned subset. HP scales gently: `BASE_COMBATANT_HP + ⌊(round-1)/2⌋ × 2`. Reuses `shopSeedFor` with a sentinel reroll-offset `7 × 65521` so ghost seeds never collide with shop seeds at the same round. **Not** a port of `packages/sim/test/determinism/ghost-generator.ts` (test scaffolding, ratified do-not-import in production); fresh + simpler builder, intentionally narrow design surface, easy to delete when M2 ghost storage replaces it.

- **Round resolution + history flow.** `combat_done` action carries `result: CombatResult`, `opponentGhostId`, `damageDealt`, `damageTaken`. Reducer applies:
  - **Win:** +`ruleset.winBonusGold`, +18 trophy (M0-placeholder, see ratification 5), hearts unchanged.
  - **Loss:** +0 gold, +0 trophy, hearts −= 1 (clamped to 0).
  - **Draw:** treated as loss for hearts.
  - **Always:** append a canonical `RunHistoryEntry { round, outcome, damageDealt, damageTaken, goldEarnedThisRound, opponentGhostId }` to `runState.history`.
  - Run-end detection (hearts === 0 → eliminated screen) deferred to M1.5.

  `RoundResolution.tsx` consumes the new props (round, outcome, damageDealt, damageTaken, goldEarned, trophyEarned, hearts, maxHearts) — VICTORY / DEFEAT header, real +gold / +trophy values, real hearts/maxHearts, DEALT / TAKEN line. Loss path uses `--life-stroke` for the header colour to telegraph the heart cost. `LogTab` reads `runState.history` directly (mock removed). Desktop `BottomPanel` reads the most recent history entry (or `"0 ROUNDS · awaiting first combat"` empty state).

- **`scoutRecipes` + `[Crafting]` two-section ratification (closes M1.3.3 carry-forward 1 — option-A active recipes mirror was the M1.3.3 close; the §7.2 second section deferred to M1.3.4a).** `apps/client/src/run/recipes.ts` exports `scoutRecipes(bag) → Recipe[]` — multiset match over `bag.itemId`, no adjacency requirement. The mobile `[Crafting]` tab now renders two sections:
  - **READY TO CRAFT** — recipes whose inputs are 4-edge-adjacent (output of `detectRecipes`); each row is a tappable COMBINE target. Empty-state copy unchanged: "Place items adjacent to see combinations."
  - **AVAILABLE WITH CURRENT ITEMS** — recipes whose inputs are present but not yet adjacent (output of `scoutRecipes` minus the ready set so sections stay disjoint). Read-only preview with REARRANGE pill. Empty-state copy: "No recipes possible with current items." Section is **always rendered** even when empty (Trey screenshot review — hiding it made the §7.2 layout look unimplemented on a starting bag). Auto-rearrange affordance over this list is M3 hint-system work.

### Screenshot-review hotfixes + lazy-boundary correction

- **Commit 5 (screenshot review).** Trey's halt-gate screenshot review caught two blockers that step-1–4 missed:
  1. Desktop `BottomPanel` rendered a hardcoded "R3 · won vs ghost (Marauder) · 6 dmg dealt · 3 dmg taken" string regardless of run state. The literal survived data.local dissolution by being JSX-baked rather than living in `data.local.ts`. Fixed by reading `state.history[state.history.length - 1]` with an empty-state fallback ("0 ROUNDS · awaiting first combat").
  2. Mobile `CraftingTab` hid the AVAILABLE WITH CURRENT ITEMS section entirely when `scoutedRecipes` was empty — the common starting case (one Iron Dagger in bag → no scoutable recipes) made the §7.2 two-section layout invisible. Fixed by always rendering the section header + count with an empty-state row ("No recipes possible with current items.") when no scouted recipes match. Test rewritten to assert both sections' empty states render simultaneously.
  Verification ask 3 (HP reconciliation between mid-tick CombatOverlay and RoundResolution) reconciled by code walk: `playerHp` derives from each damage event's `remainingHp` (sim's authoritative value), advancing tick-by-tick; at `currentTick > endedAtTick` the displayed HP equals `result.finalHp.player`. Image 2's mid-tick "12/30" was a frozen frame from the playback (player took 18 of 30 total damage so far). No code change needed.

- **Commit 6 (lazy-boundary correction; closing-pass audit finding caught before the closing-log committed).** Step 2's lazy-load split shipped `CombatOverlay` JSX + `ghost.ts` + `RoundResolution` into the combat chunk but **left the entire sim runtime in main**. The original step-2 implementation imported `simulateCombat` statically from a `sim-bridge.ts` that was shared between main-chunk consumers (ShopController, RunController, ghost.ts) and the combat-chunk consumer (CombatOverlay). Vite's chunk-splitting heuristic hoisted the shared bridge to the common ancestor (main); the static-import edge for `simulateCombat` rode along with it, dragging the combat-only sim subgraph (`combat.ts` + `status.ts` + `triggers.ts`) into main. Sourcemap audit at the closing pass surfaced the violation: title-screen / pre-combat users were paying the full sim parse cost despite the `tech-architecture.md` § 10 invariant. Fix: split the bridge into `apps/client/src/run/sim-bridge.ts` (shop-side, no `simulateCombat` import) + `apps/client/src/combat/sim-bridge.combat.ts` (NEW, combat-side, imports `simulateCombat` and exports `runCombat`). Neither bridge imports the other. Post-split sourcemap audit confirms `combat.ts` / `status.ts` / `triggers.ts` ship exclusively in the combat chunk; main's sim imports are limited to `rng.ts` / `iteration.ts` / `math.ts` / `run/shop.ts`. This documentation pattern mirrors M1.3.3's Codex P1 hotfix sub-section: original close + post-close correction unified under one heading.

### Bundle delta

- **vs. M1.3.3 close** (244.93 KB raw / 75.65 KB gzipped main; 12.06 KB raw / 3.22 KB gzipped mobile chunk; 78 modules):
  - **Main chunk:** 243.02 KB raw / 75.84 KB gzipped — Δ −1.91 KB raw (−0.78%) / +0.19 KB gzipped (+0.25%). Within the ≤+5% gzipped target ✓ — sim's combat code moved OUT (combat-chunk-bound), and the bridge / content / types / ShopController / glue moved IN, netting roughly zero. **Desktop pre-combat users actually save raw bytes vs. M1.3.3 baseline.**
  - **Combat chunk (NEW, lazy):** 22.19 KB raw / 7.50 KB gzipped — additive, only loaded when the player presses Continue. Includes `CombatOverlay` + `ghost.ts` + `sim-bridge.combat.ts` + `RoundResolution` + sim's `combat.ts` + `status.ts` + `triggers.ts` + `iteration.ts`.
  - **Mobile chunk:** 13.85 KB raw / 3.44 KB gzipped — Δ +1.79 KB raw / +0.22 KB gzipped (absorbs the scouted-section JSX).
  - **CSS:** 10.05 KB / 2.97 KB gzipped — unchanged.
  - **Modules:** 78 → 99 (+21: sim-bridge + sim-bridge.combat + content + types + ShopController + ShopController.test + recipes.test + ghost + ghost.test + LazyCombatOverlay + various adjacent test/source pairs, split across 3 chunks — main + combat + mobile).
  - First-load cost for desktop pre-combat is **lower** than M1.3.3 close: combat chunk fetched on-demand at the Continue button press.

### Tests

- Workspace baseline at M1.3.3 close (per project convention: client + ui-kit, sim/content tests not folded into "workspace"): **75 across 15 files** (48 client / 12 files + 27 ui-kit / 3 files).
  - **Added (+24 tests across 3 new files + 2 expansions):** `recipes.test.ts` (NEW, +8 = 5 detectRecipes regression migrated from `data.local.test.ts` + 3 scoutRecipes); `ghost.test.ts` (NEW, +7); `ShopController.test.ts` (NEW, +5); `CraftingTab.test.tsx` (4 → 6, +2); `RunController.test.ts` (9 → 11, +2 covering combat_done loss path + 0-hearts clamp).
  - **Deleted (−5 tests across 1 file):** `data.local.test.ts` (5 detectRecipes regression tests; migrated into `recipes.test.ts` alongside the 3 new scoutRecipes tests).
  - **Net delta:** +19 tests / +3 files. **Workspace post-M1.3.4a: 94 across 18 files** (67 client / 15 files + 27 ui-kit / 3 files). Sim 466 tests / 13 files + content 30 tests / 1 file unchanged. Turbo pipeline 25/25 tasks green.

### Files added (`apps/client/src/`)

- `run/sim-bridge.ts` (shop-side bridge)
- `combat/sim-bridge.combat.ts` (combat-side bridge — NEW at step 6)
- `run/types.ts`
- `run/content.ts`
- `run/recipes.test.ts`
- `shop/ShopController.ts`
- `shop/ShopController.test.ts`
- `combat/ghost.ts`
- `combat/ghost.test.ts`
- `combat/LazyCombatOverlay.tsx`

### Files deleted

- `apps/client/src/data.local.ts`
- `apps/client/src/data.local.test.ts`

### Files modified non-trivially

`run/RunController.ts`, `run/useRun.ts`, `bag/layout.ts`, `run/recipes.ts`, `combat/CombatOverlay.tsx`, `screens/RoundResolution.tsx`, `screens/mobile/tabs/CraftingTab.tsx`, `screens/mobile/tabs/LogTab.tsx`, `hud/BottomPanel.tsx`, `screens/{DesktopRunScreen, mobile/MobileRunScreen}.tsx`, `icons/icons.tsx`, plus 15 other test/component files swept for new import homes.

### Documented carry-forwards

  1. **Phaser combat overlay → M1.3.4b** (replaces the DOM portraits/HP-bars with the Phaser scene). Combat chunk already lazy-split, so adding Phaser is purely additive to the combat chunk size.
  2. **Real-device drag-state screenshot capture** (carry-forward from M1.3.3) → still deferred; surfaces alongside M1.3.4b if Phaser scene work makes mobile real-device testing in-scope.
  3. **`combat/CombatOverlay.tsx` portrait character-art (3 hex sites)** → M1.3.4b (Phaser replacement supersedes; the carry-forward sites are now in the DOM Portrait component, easy to replace wholesale).
  4. **@dnd-kit `DragOverlay` rotation visual polish** → M1.3.4b or later (carry-forward from M1.3.2 / M1.3.3; not surfaced this sub-phase).
  5. **Run-end detection (hearts === 0 → eliminated)** → M1.5 (alongside class-select screen + relic state machinery + LocalSaveV1 persistence).
  6. **State-driven bag dimensions through pure helpers** → M2 (when contract mutators rewrite bag size; until then `BAG_COLS` / `BAG_ROWS` derived constants are sufficient).
  7a. **`opponentClassId` field on `RunHistoryEntry`** → M1.5 (replaces the round-parity class derivation in `LogTab` + `BottomPanel`; the field is local to the client-side history record, not server state, so it can land independently of M2 ghost storage).
  7b. **Server-side ghost record (per-(round, trophy_band) GhostBuild storage)** → M2 (replaces `combat/ghost.ts`'s procedural template entirely; the carry-forward language treats `combat/ghost.ts` as a placeholder explicitly designed to be deleted).
  8. **Auto-rearrange hint affordance over the AVAILABLE WITH CURRENT ITEMS section** → M3 (hint-system work).
  9. **Per-round trophy schedule + contract modifiers + win-streak multipliers** → M2 (closes the +18-placeholder ratification 5).
  10. **`RarityGem` for shop rarity dot** (carry-forward from M1.3.2; not surfaced this sub-phase).
  11. **`apps/client/src/index.css` `.glow-*` rgba palette derivatives** (carry-forward from M1.3.2 / M1.3.3).

### Branch hygiene

6 implementation commits + closing entry on `m1.3.4a-sim-wire-up`, branched off main (`0b07722`). `--no-ff` merge to main once Trey confirms CI green on origin.

### Next

**M1.3.4b** (Phaser combat scene). The DOM combat overlay shipped this sub-phase is the placeholder that proves the sim path; M1.3.4b is purely a render-layer swap (Phaser replaces the Portrait + HP-bar DOM tree). No new sim integration, no new state surface — the combat chunk's bytes grow to absorb Phaser, but the architectural shape is set.

### Codex P1 catch + reroll-cost authority fix (commit 8)

- **Codex Review on PR #6 caught a P1 on the closing-pass tree:** `ShopPanel.tsx` (and the mobile `ShopTab` equivalent) computed reroll affordability as `state.rerollCount + 1`, while the reducer charged via sim's `computeRerollCost(rerollsThisRound, rerollCostStart, rerollCostIncrement, extraRerollsPerRound)` per ratification 3. Default ruleset values (`rerollCostStart=1`, `rerollCostIncrement=1`, `EXTRA_REROLLS_PER_ROUND=0`) made the formulas incidentally agree. Divergence surfaces as soon as M1.5 lands relics with non-zero `extraRerollsPerRound`, or contract mutators modify the cost curve.

- **Fix:** hoisted the placeholder `EXTRA_REROLLS_PER_ROUND` const + a pass-through re-export of `computeRerollCost` into `run/sim-bridge.ts` so the reducer + `ShopPanel` + `ShopTab` share one authoritative source. `RunController` imports both from sim-bridge instead of `@packbreaker/sim` directly + a local const; `ShopPanel` + `ShopTab` replace the `+ 1` arithmetic with the same `computeRerollCost(...)` call. Test fixture comments updated (`ShopPanel.test.tsx`, `RunContext.test.tsx`); rendered values unchanged (cost is still 1 for default ruleset, so all assertions hold).

- **Architectural rule reinforced + documented inline at `run/sim-bridge.ts`:** _UI affordability state never reimplements game-rule arithmetic — it consumes the authoritative formula from sim._ Future shop-related ratifications inherit this rule. Sweep audit on `apps/client/src` for `rerollCount + 1` and other local affordability arithmetic returned zero remaining sites.

- **Sourcemap audit re-confirms post-fix chunk integrity unchanged.** `computeRerollCost` lives in `packages/sim/src/run/shop.ts` (already in main per the M1.3.4a step 6 split), so the re-export adds no combat-side sim modules to main. Combat chunk still owns `combat.ts` / `status.ts` / `triggers.ts` / `iteration.ts`; main's sim imports remain `rng.ts` / `math.ts` / `run/shop.ts`.

- **Updated stats:** test count **67 / 15 client files** unchanged (assertion values unchanged at default ruleset; only test comments updated); workspace total **94 / 18 files** unchanged. Main chunk **243.10 KB raw / 75.86 KB gzipped** (was 243.02 / 75.84 — Δ +0.08 KB raw / +0.02 KB gzipped from re-export glue). Mobile chunk 13.92 KB raw / 3.47 KB gzipped (Δ +0.07 / +0.03 KB from ShopTab call-site swap). Combat chunk 22.19 KB raw / 7.50 KB gzipped (unchanged). All bundle-delta budgets still satisfied (main +0.39% raw / +0.28% gzipped vs. M1.3.3 baseline). Modules 99 (was 99 — re-export glue lives inside an existing module).

- **Updated branch hygiene:** 8 implementation commits + closing-log amendment (commit 9) on `m1.3.4a-sim-wire-up` (commits 1–4 implementation + 5 screenshot-review hotfix + 6 lazy-boundary correction + 7 closing log + 8 Codex P1 hotfix + 9 = this closing-log amendment). Branch force-pushed to origin after the hotfix lands so the PR re-runs CI against the corrected tree.

## 2026-05-01 — M1.3.3 closed (mobile responsive 390-wide vertical layout)

- First sub-phase to target a viewport other than desktop. Layout reflows per `gdd.md` § 14 mobile spec; visual register from M1.3.2 carries forward unchanged across mobile (no mobile-specific palette extensions, no mobile-specific typography deviations, no mobile-specific easing curves). Trey-confirmed via 12-of-14 screenshot review in chat.

- **Layout audit ratifications:**
  1. **Opponent intent → top-bar element.** `GhostGlyph` 18px + two 20px monochrome silhouette swatches (sword + shield) inline. No explicit class label — the silhouette pair pattern implies the apparent class per `gdd.md` § 14 ("opponent intent shows the opponent's apparent class and 1–2 marquee item silhouettes — never their full bag pre-combat").
  2. **Class passive → `[Relics]` tab header card.** Tinker glyph + class name + "+10% recipe potency" passive text. Header card precedes the relic slots in the Relics tab.
  3. **Silhouettes → top-bar inline** (collapsed into Decision 1 — silhouettes ride with the opponent-intent block, not a separate top-bar item).
  4. **`[Crafting]` tab → active recipes mirror** (option A). Lists the recipes currently ready to combine, each row a tappable COMBINE target. Mirrors (does not replace) the COMBINE buttons anchored on the bag itself — provides an ergonomic backup for awkward combine-anchor positions. Empty state copy: "No recipes ready. Place items adjacent to see combinations." Recipe scouting (recipes-you-could-make-with-current-items) deferred to M1.3.4 with sim integration.
  5. **`[Log]` tab → vertical stack of round entries.** R1/R2/R3 line items with WON/LOST + damage summary (mock data until M1.3.4 sim integration provides real per-round results). **Last-round damage chart remains deferred on both desktop and mobile; revisit when telemetry surfaces a need.**
  6. **Tab-content layout → stacked** (option ii — bag upper, tab content lower). Bag must always be visible per visual-direction.md § 1 (60%-of-smaller-dim floor). Stack: top bar 44 + bag 240 (4 × 52px cells + 32px padding, BAG/items-placed header+footer rows hidden via `compact` prop) + tab content ~360 scrollable + tab bar 56 + Continue CTA 56 = 756 of 844 viewport.
  7. **Floating CTA → option C (full-width bar).** Closes `visual-direction.md` § 13 question 4. Always-visible regardless of active tab; reroll moves to `[Shop]` tab header (visible only when Shop is active). User can tap Continue from any tab without first switching back to Shop. Largest tap target (≈390 × 56 vs floating-pill ≈64 × 40); no dual-meaning confusion.
  8. **Breakpoint mechanism → JS viewport-detect at 768px** (`window.matchMedia('(max-width: 767px)')` + `useState` + `change` event listener in `apps/client/src/run/useViewport.ts`). Two orchestrators sharing primitives; only the active layout's component tree mounts at a time, which keeps @dnd-kit sensor config (PointerSensor on desktop, PointerSensor + TouchSensor on mobile) cleanly per-layout. Tablet/intermediate (768–1024) reads as desktop per `gdd.md` § 14. Breakpoint flicker mitigations (debounce, persist-last-active) deferred — revisit only if a user reports it.

- **Lazy-load mobile (commit 8.5) per option-B ratification on bundle-delta halt.** `MobileRunScreen` loaded on-demand via `React.lazy(() => import('./mobile/MobileRunScreen'))` + minimal `<Suspense fallback={<MobileFallback />}>` wrapper at the dispatcher level. Desktop branch stays default-synchronous. Per `tech-architecture.md` § 10's mid-tier-mobile parse-time budget, raw bytes matter as much as gzipped transmission — the mobile-only payload doesn't ship to desktop users. Sets the precedent for M1.3.4 Phaser code-splitting.

- **Viewport-meta fix (commit 8.6).** Trey's first-pass screenshot capture surfaced a real bug: M0's `<meta name="viewport" content="width=1280" />` graybox hack was forcing all browsers (including Chrome DevTools mobile emulation) to use a 1280-wide layout viewport, which made `matchMedia('(max-width: 767px)').matches` return false at 390-wide → useViewport returned 'desktop' → DesktopRunScreen rendered inside the 390-wide canvas. Fix: meta updated to `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`. The useViewport hook + dispatcher logic were correct as-is. The pre-M1.3.3 hack made graybox desktop viewable on phones for design review without responsive implementation; M1.3.3 makes mobile a real surface so the hack must go.

- **Mobile components added** (`apps/client/src/`):
  - `screens/mobile/MobileRunScreen.tsx` — orchestrator. Wraps `DndContext` + `<CellSizeProvider value={52}>` + stacked layout. Combines PointerSensor (mouse/stylus fallback) + TouchSensor (200ms long-press, 5px tolerance).
  - `screens/mobile/MobileTabBar.tsx` — 4-tab shell (Shop / Crafting / Relics / Log), default = Shop, active-tab indicator (2px accent border-top + heading-tight), tabs ≥ 44×56 touch targets.
  - `screens/mobile/tabs/{ShopTab,CraftingTab,RelicsTab,LogTab}.tsx` — tab content panels.
  - `screens/mobile/MobileContinueCTA.tsx` — full-width × 56px bottom bar Continue.
  - `hud/mobile/MobileTopBar.tsx` — compact 44px top bar with gold/hearts/round + opponent intent.
  - `bag/CellSize.tsx` — `CellSizeContext` (default 88) + `CellSizeProvider` + `useCellSize` hook. Mobile orchestrator wraps with `value={52}`. Pure pixel-math utilities in `bag/layout.ts` (combineAnchorPosition + helpers) parameterized by `cellSize` arg defaulting to the desktop constant.
  - `shop/SellZone.tsx` — extracted from `ShopPanel.tsx`'s inline subcomponent for shared use between desktop ShopPanel and mobile ShopTab.
  - `bag/BagBoard.tsx` — added `compact` prop (default false) hiding the BAG/items-placed header+footer rows so the mobile bag area fits 240px.
  - `shop/ShopSlot.tsx` — added `cardWidth` prop default 110 (desktop) so mobile ShopTab can pass `'100%'` and slots fill the wider mobile grid columns.

- `bag/`, `shop/`, `packages/ui-kit/` — shared between desktop and mobile, no fork. CellSize context drives the per-layout pixel scale.

- **Touch ergonomics:** @dnd-kit `TouchSensor` wired with 200ms `delay` + 5px `tolerance` activation. **Tap-tap rotate** during drag implemented via window-level `touchstart` listener in `useRun.ts`: while `dragRef.current` is non-null, a second concurrent touch (`touches.length >= 2`) fires `drag_rotate`. Same square-no-op gating as the R-key path. **Touch-target audit:** all interactive mobile elements ≥ 44×44 WCAG-AA floor (tab buttons ~95×56, REROLL minHeight 44, COMBINE rows minHeight 44, Continue CTA full-width × 56, ShopSlot cards ~159×140, bag cells 52×52). **Pinch-zoom + scroll lock during drag:** `touch-action: none` applied to the bag's inner board container so taps on empty cells and items both inhibit native pinch/scroll.

- **Recipe-glow halo legibility verified at 52px cell — confirmed readable.** Per-cell rect rendering retained at the smaller mobile scale; the failure mode the M0 spec named (internal seam fighting halo) does not surface. M0 deferred item 2 stays closed; perimeter-path revival NOT needed for mobile. Per Trey's screenshot ratification, shared edges between cluster cells read as part of dashed marching pattern, not as internal seams. Mobile cell size does not trigger the busy-read failure mode.

- **Visual register continuity:** zero mobile-specific palette extensions, zero mobile-specific typography deviations, zero mobile-specific easing curves. Inter weights 400/500/600/700 + tabular numerals + cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) all flow through unchanged. Desktop screenshots 13–14 confirm desktop did NOT regress at 1280×720 or at 1024×768 (intermediate width correctly routes to desktop layout).

- **12 of 14 screenshots delivered** (mobile 3–12 + desktop 13–14). Mobile screenshots 1 (mid-drag valid outline) and 2 (invalid drop shake) not captured due to a documented OS-tooling limitation: standard screenshot keystrokes release the drag mid-capture under Chrome DevTools mobile emulation, since the touch is held by the mouse pointer that the screenshot tool interrupts. Workarounds (touch event recording, video capture, real-device testing) add tooling complexity beyond M1.3.3 scope. Behavioral parity for drag affordances verified IMPLICITLY across screenshots 3–7 (drag-to-place, recipe detection, four-direction first-fit anchor, combine flow all functional). Skip framed as a tooling limitation, NOT a regression. Revisit at M1.3.4 if real-device testing becomes in-scope alongside Phaser combat overlay work.

- **Bundle delta vs. M1.3.2 close (242.15 KB JS / 9.94 KB CSS / 74.47 KB gzipped / 64 modules):**
  - **Desktop-only bundle:** 244.63 KB raw / 75.52 KB gzipped — Δ +2.48 KB raw (+1.02%) / +1.05 KB gzipped (+1.41%). Within ≤+5% on both axes ✓
  - **Mobile chunk (lazy):** 12.06 KB raw / 3.22 KB gzipped — additive, only loaded when viewport < 768px
  - **Total (mobile users):** 256.69 KB raw / 78.74 KB gzipped — first-load cost on mobile only, then cached
  - **CSS:** 10.05 KB (+0.11 KB / +1.11%) — within ≤+30% budget ✓
  - **Modules:** 64 → 77 (+13: 12 mobile-component files + 1 lazy-chunk runtime metadata, split across 2 chunks)
  - Pre-lazy single-chunk build was 255.00 KB / 76.35 KB gzipped (76 modules); the split adds ~1.7 KB raw / ~2.4 KB gzipped of code-splitting overhead but only mobile users pay it. **Desktop users save 10.37 KB raw / 0.83 KB gzipped vs the un-split build.**

- **Tests:** ui-kit 27 (unchanged); client **46** (was 31; +15 across 5 new test files: `screens/RunScreen.test.tsx` ×2 [desktop sync + lazy mobile via `waitFor`], `screens/mobile/MobileTabBar.test.tsx` ×4, `screens/mobile/MobileContinueCTA.test.tsx` ×3, `screens/mobile/tabs/CraftingTab.test.tsx` ×4, `screens/mobile/tabs/RelicsTab.test.tsx` ×2). Workspace total **73 across 14 test files**, all passing. Turbo pipeline 19/19 tasks green.

- **Documented carry-forwards** (most converging at M1.3.4):
  1. `shop/ShopController.ts` split → M1.3.4 (sim integration creates real shop action surfaces)
  2. `data.local.ts` full dissolution → M1.3.4
  3. `combat/CombatOverlay.tsx` portrait character-art (3 hex sites) → M1.3.4 (Phaser replacement)
  4. @dnd-kit `DragOverlay` rotation visual polish → M1.3.4 (non-blocking observation, carry-forward from M1.3.2)
  5. **Mobile drag-state screenshot capture** (touch + screenshot tool conflict under DevTools emulation) → M1.3.4 if real-device testing becomes in-scope
  6. `apps/client/src/index.css` `.glow-*` `rgba()` palette derivatives (5 entries) → M1.3.3+ if revisited (carry-forward from M1.3.2; not surfaced this sub-phase)
  7. **Viewport-meta side-effect:** `DesktopRunScreen` at fixed 1280px width may show horizontal scroll on desktop browser windows narrower than 1280 with the new responsive meta. Not visible at the 1024×768 verification capture; M1.3.4+ if it surfaces at narrower widths (desktop responsive layout would fix it).

- **Branch hygiene:** 9 implementation commits (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.5, 8.6) + closing entry on `m1.3.3-mobile-responsive`, branched off main (`0d9803b`). `--no-ff` merge to main once Trey confirms CI green on origin.

- **M1.3.4** (sim integration + Phaser combat overlay) is next. **This is the inflection point:** `data.local.ts` dissolves, `packages/sim` integrates into the client bundle (lazy-loaded alongside Phaser, following the M1.3.3 mobile-chunk precedent), canned 4-second combat replaced by deterministic playback of real combat events. The game stops being a UI demo and starts being a deterministic real game.

### Codex P1 catch + hotfix (commit 10)

- **Codex Review on PR #5 caught a P1 regression on the lazy-loaded dispatcher:** the cross-breakpoint orchestrator swap destroyed `useRun` state. Both `DesktopRunScreen` and `MobileRunScreen` independently called `useRun()`, so when the dispatcher swapped one for the other (rotation, window resize across 768px), the leaving orchestrator's `useReducer` state was destroyed and the new tree started from `INITIAL_CLIENT_STATE`. Bag, shop, gold, hearts, round all reset. Regressed M1.3.2's single-orchestrator behavior.

- **Hotfix:** lifted `useRun()` into a new `RunProvider` (option B from Trey's ratification — Context over prop drilling). `screens/RunScreen.tsx` now wraps its children in `<RunProvider>`; both orchestrators consume via `useRunContext()` instead of calling `useRun()` independently. The provider stays mounted across the dispatcher's child swap, so the underlying `useReducer` state persists across viewport switches.

- **New files:**
  - `apps/client/src/run/RunContext.tsx` — `RunContext` + `RunProvider` + `useRunContext` hook. Throws a clear error if consumed outside the provider.
  - `apps/client/src/run/RunContext.test.tsx` (+2 tests) — direct regression coverage. (1) "preserves state when the provider child subtree swaps" mutates state in child A (gold 8 → 7, rerollCount 0 → 1), swaps the provider's children to B, asserts B reads the preserved state, mutates again from B (gold 7 → 5, rerollCount 1 → 2). Unit-test analog of a viewport-driven orchestrator swap. (2) "throws a clear error when useRunContext is called outside `<RunProvider>`" — defensive invariant.

- **Architectural rule (project-wide, carry-forward to M1.3.4+):** _Lazy-loaded sub-tree dispatchers must own any state that should persist across the dispatch boundary. State below the dispatcher's swap point is destroyed on every swap._ Documented inline at `run/RunContext.tsx`. M1.3.4 Phaser will follow the same lazy-load pattern; any combat-scene state that should persist across mount/unmount cycles must live above the lazy boundary.

- **Updated stats:** test count **75 across 15 files** (was 73/14); main chunk **244.93 KB raw / 75.65 KB gzipped** (was 244.63 / 75.52 — +0.30 KB raw / +0.13 KB gzipped from `RunContext.tsx` + glue). All bundle-delta budgets still satisfied (desktop +1.15% raw / +1.58% gzipped vs M1.3.2 baseline). Mobile chunk unchanged at 12.06 KB / 3.22 KB. CSS unchanged at 10.07 KB. Modules 78 (was 77, +1 RunContext file).

- **Updated branch hygiene:** 11 implementation commits on `m1.3.3-mobile-responsive` (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8.5, 8.6, 9 = original closing entry, 10 = Codex hotfix, 11 = this closing-log amendment). Branch force-pushed to origin after the hotfix lands so the PR re-runs CI against the corrected tree.

## 2026-05-01 — M1.3.2 closed (visual styling pass + ui-kit primitive promotion)

- Visual-direction.md compliance landed across `apps/client/src/`. First sub-phase where the game looks like the locked Gridline direction rather than the prototype skin. Behavioral parity vs. M1.3.1 preserved end-to-end (Trey-confirmed via 12-screenshot review in chat).

- **ui-kit promotion (M1.3.1 deviation 2 closed):** `RarityFrame` + `ItemIcon` promoted from `apps/client/src/ui-kit-overrides/` to `packages/ui-kit/`. Adds new `RarityGem` primitive (5 SVG corner-gem shapes ◆■▲★✦ via `currentColor`) — promoted as part of the rarity-frame visual treatment in commit 4. 27 tests in `packages/ui-kit/src/*.test.tsx` (12 RarityFrame + 9 RarityGem + 6 ItemIcon). `apps/client/src/ui-kit-overrides/` directory deleted entirely; the 3 import sites swept directly to `@packbreaker/ui-kit` (re-export shim approach rejected — single mechanical sweep keeps mid-styling-pass churn lower per Trey ratification at commit 1).

  - `ItemIcon` API changed from `itemId`-based lookup to children-based transform wrapper. The ICONS map is content-tied to apps/client and doesn't belong in ui-kit; consuming sites in apps/client now do their own `ICONS[itemId]` lookup at the call site and pass the result as children. Documented as an intentional API shift, not a "same component API" regression.
  - `packages/ui-kit/` test infrastructure: vitest@^2.1.8 + @testing-library/react + @testing-library/jest-dom + happy-dom + @vitejs/plugin-react + vite added as devDeps. Inline vitest config in `packages/ui-kit/vite.config.ts` (happy-dom env, setupFiles). package.json `test` script changed from echo-stub to `vitest run`. tsconfig excludes `*.test.ts(x)` from the `dist/` build output.

- **Color audit (post-pass: zero non-token UI chrome refs except documented combat character art):**

  | Bucket | Pre-M1.3.2 | Post-M1.3.2 |
  |---|---|---|
  | Inline-hex UI chrome | 26 | **3** (combat portrait character art only — `#1D4ED8`/`#334155`/`#475569` + `${hex}33` boxShadow alpha; documented inline as M1.3.4 Phaser replacement) |
  | Inline-hex item-icon ART (icons.tsx) | 78 | 78 (exempt per § 5 body-color rule, content-side identity colors) |
  | `:root` CSS-variable defs (index.css) | 18 | 18 (these ARE the canonical tokens) |
  | Tailwind arbitrary classes (`bg-[#xyz]` etc.) | 0 | 0 (never an issue) |
  | `var(--*)` references in source | (~50) | (~73, +23 swept) |
  | `#FFFFFF` violations of § 3 ("pure white forbidden") | 2 | **0** (CTA buttons NEXT ROUND + CONTINUE swept to `var(--text-primary)`) |

  Two semantic UI extensions (`life-red`, `coin-gold`) audited for canonical-context-only usage and confirmed compliant: `life-red` (hearts, damage indicator, invalid-drop affordance, sell-zone "destroy item" affordance — all within "hearts and damage" category); `coin-gold` (coin glyph, gold-amount displays, REROLL cost, COMBINE button border — within scope; the `#F59E0B` shared-hex with `rarity-legendary` never collides on the same surface per § 3). No third semantic extension attempted.

- **Typography:** Inter loaded from Google Fonts at `apps/client/index.html` (carry-over from M0; verified). Weights 400/500/600/700 applied per § 4. `apps/client/tailwind.config.js` `theme.fontFamily.sans` extended to `['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif']`. **Tabular numerals confirmed on 10 numeric-display locations** (audit fixed 2 missed sites in commit 2): `hud/TopBar.tsx` gold + hearts max-count grid + round/totalRounds + trophy; `bag/BagBoard.tsx` items-placed footer + recipes-ready footer; `shop/ShopPanel.tsx` REROLLS counter + REROLL cost; `shop/ShopSlot.tsx` item cost; `combat/CombatOverlay.tsx` damage numbers + burn-stack count; `screens/RoundResolution.tsx` gold/trophy/hearts ratios.

- **Rarity frame system:** 1px border in rarity color (was 2px in M1.3.1; matches "no heavy chrome" per § 6) + corner gem rendered as inline SVG (replaces Unicode-character rendering per task §3 + the M0 inline-SVG decision; 5 distinct shapes — Diamond / Square / Triangle / Star / Sparkle — via `RarityGem` component using `fill="currentColor"`) + soft inner glow scaled to rarity (was uniform inline alpha in M1.3.1). New per-rarity `glowAlpha` (hex 2-char) + `glowBlur` (px) fields on `RarityDef`: common 1A/10px (subtle) → uncommon 2D/13px → rare 38/16px → epic 47/19px → legendary 57/22px (prominent). Dual-coding silhouette discipline test #1 verified — the five gem shapes have distinct silhouette mass distributions (no two share more than ~30% overlap), color-blind safety preserved.

- **Body-color rule audit (12 items, all PASS):** documented inline at the top of `apps/client/src/icons/icons.tsx` as a frozen audit table. 4 items pass via material-identity matching their rarity register (iron-sword, iron-dagger, whetstone, steel-sword); 1 via material identity (wooden-shield, brown = wood); 1 via plant-identity matching own rarity (healing-salve); 6 via Option A identity-color exception (healing-herb, spark-stone, apple, copper-coin, ember-brand, fire-oil). Two notable surface-color overlaps that remain compliant in context: spark-stone + copper-coin body fills include `#F59E0B` (= rarity-legendary frame color) — identity rule (fire / gold currency) overrides + the surface-non-collision invariant (§ 3 — coin glyphs never appear inside a Legendary item frame) keeps them safe; steel-sword's `#94A3B8` gradient stop = rarity-common color but is metallic-base material identity, not signal-color body fill.

- **Recipe-glow evaluation (M0 deferred item 2 closed):** screenshot-driven decision in commit 7 ratified **halo**. **Per-cell rect rendering retained.** Evaluation on the post-styling-pass visual register (1px frame borders, 1.5s/cycle marching dash, rarity-keyed alpha pulse) showed unified halo legibility on both 2-cell and 3-cell clusters; the failure mode the M0 spec named (internal seam fighting halo) did not surface. Perimeter-path approach (~30 lines edge-traversal geometry per the M0 deferred item 2 spec) deferred indefinitely; revisit only if telemetry/playtest surfaces "busy" read in cluster shapes not exercised here (4+ cell clusters, L-shapes, T-shapes — none of which exist in M1 recipe content per `balance-bible.md` § 11). Closure rationale also annotated in `apps/client/src/bag/RecipeGlow.tsx` header for traceability.

- **Motion language (cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)):** drop-settle adjusted from 160ms → **120ms** in `bag/DraggableItem.tsx` (matches § 7 "placement settles in 120ms"). ShopSlot transform timing 140ms → 120ms for consistency. New `.hover-lift` CSS class (`filter: brightness(1.06)` on `:hover:not(:disabled)`, 120ms ease-snap transition, no rotation/scale) applied to the 4 CTA buttons: REROLL, CONTINUE, COMBINE → output, NEXT ROUND. Recipe glow 1.5s/cycle confirmed (`recipe-march` linear + `recipe-pulse` ease-in-out). Drag pickup remains instant (no transition delay; @dnd-kit owns pickup activation).

- **Partial data.local.ts dissolution:** `RARITY` palette + `RarityKey` enum + `RarityDef` interface moved from `apps/client/src/data.local.ts` to `packages/ui-kit/src/rarity.ts`. `data.local.ts` retains a re-export shim for back-compat with consumers that still import RARITY from there (full sweep deferred to M1.3.4 with the rest of `data.local.ts`'s dissolution). 3 of 22 M1.3.1-baseline import sites now resolve through `@packbreaker/ui-kit` directly (the consumers that import `RarityFrame`/`ItemIcon`/`RarityGem`); the remaining 19 (RARITY/RarityKey/ITEMS/SEED_*/types/helpers consumers) continue importing from `data.local`. Full dissolution still M1.3.4 with sim integration creating real shop/Ruleset surfaces.

- **12 screenshots delivered** (9 reproducing M1.3.1 set in new visual register + 3 new compliance shots). Behavioral parity preserved: drag valid/invalid affordances, R-key rotation, recipe detection, four-direction first-fit anchor logic, four-second canned combat, round-resolution overlay all work identically. Visual compliance confirmed: palette tokens consistent, Inter typography + tabular numerals visible in close-up, rarity frame system (1px border + SVG gem + scaled inner glow) renders dual-coded, body-color rule preserved on Healing Herb (plant green) vs. Whetstone (slate metal) shared-Common comparison.

- **Bundle delta vs. M1.3.1 close (240.51 KB JS / 9.89 KB CSS / 74.09 KB gzipped / 61 modules):**
  - JS: **242.15 KB** (+1.64 KB / **+0.68%**) — within ≤+5% budget ✓
  - CSS: **9.94 KB** (+0.05 KB / +0.51%) — within ≤+20% budget ✓
  - Gzipped JS: **74.47 KB** (+0.38 KB / +0.51%) — within ≤+5% budget ✓
  - Modules: 61 → **64** (+3: ui-kit's `RarityFrame`, `ItemIcon`, `RarityGem`)
  - ui-kit chunk produced: bundled into the main client chunk (workspace TS-source consumption — no separate chunk emitted; tree-shake confirmed by the small +1.64 KB delta against the M1.3.1 baseline that already included ui-kit-overrides versions of RarityFrame + ItemIcon).

- **Test counts:** ui-kit 27 (was 0 — pure addition, RarityFrame×12 + RarityGem×9 + ItemIcon×6); client 27 (unchanged). Workspace total **54 across 9 test files**. Turbo pipeline 19/19 tasks green.

- **Tooling note:** ui-kit's test environment is `happy-dom@^20` (matches `apps/client`'s convention from M1.3.1 commit 8). jsdom@29 still incompatible with the local Node 18 toolchain.

- **Documented non-blocking observation (deferred to M1.3.4):** @dnd-kit `DragOverlay` rotation rendering can show the dragged item at two positions simultaneously (origin + rotated target) with a "ghostly" silhouette during R-key rotation mid-drag. Behavioral parity vs. M1.3.1 holds (prototype had identical rendering). Visual polish on `DragOverlay` deferred to M1.3.4 alongside @dnd-kit visual styling pass + Phaser combat scene work.

- **Documented carry-forwards (all converging at M1.3.4):**
  1. `shop/ShopController.ts` split → M1.3.4 (sim integration creates real shop action surfaces)
  2. `data.local.ts` full dissolution → M1.3.4 (partial progress this sub-phase: RARITY + RarityKey + RarityDef in ui-kit; remainder pending sim integration)
  3. `combat/CombatOverlay.tsx` portrait character-art hex (3 sites) → M1.3.4 (Phaser combat scene replaces the placeholder portraits and their VFX palette)
  4. `apps/client/src/index.css` `.glow-*` classes (5 `rgba()` palette derivatives) → M1.3.3+ if revisited (currently dead code; `color-mix()` rewrite deferred)
  5. @dnd-kit `DragOverlay` rotation visual polish → M1.3.4 (per non-blocking observation above)

- **Branch hygiene:** 8 implementation commits + closing entry on `m1.3.2-visual-styling`, branched off main (`53fc2a5`). `--no-ff` merge to main once Trey confirms CI green on origin.

- **M1.3.3** (mobile responsive 390-wide vertical layout per `gdd.md` § 14) is next.

## 2026-04-30 — M1.3.1 closed (component scaffold + dnd-kit migration)

- Monolithic `apps/client/src/App.tsx` (893 lines pre-decomposition) restructured in place into `apps/client/src/` following `tech-architecture.md` § 5.1: `screens/`, `bag/`, `shop/`, `hud/`, `combat/`, `run/`, plus `icons/` and `ui-kit-overrides/` (both in § 5.1's canonical list). Component count: 14 (TopBar, LeftRail, BottomPanel, ShopPanel, ShopSlot, SellZone, BagBoard, BagCell, DraggableItem, RecipeGlow, CombatOverlay, RoundResolution, RunScreen, DragPreview). Largest production file: `hud/LeftRail.tsx` at 147 lines (under the ~200-line cap per DoD §2). `icons/icons.tsx` at 251 lines is icon-data, not a component.

- `@dnd-kit/core@^6.3.1` + `@dnd-kit/sortable@^10.0.0` installed at `apps/client/package.json`. `pnpm-lock.yaml` refreshed (+58 lines). First sub-phase to land @dnd-kit's bundle cost — was declared in the M1.3.1 prompt as "already installed but tree-shaken" but was actually never in any `package.json` until commit 2 of this branch. Replaces raw pointer-event drag from the M0 prototype: `DndContext` at `RunScreen` level with `PointerSensor` (4px activation distance) + `pointerWithin` collision detection. Each `BagCell` is `useDroppable`; each `DraggableItem` and `ShopSlot` is `useDraggable`. `DragOverlay` replaces the prototype's `DragGhost` (cursor-tracking is now @dnd-kit's responsibility — `DragState`'s `x/y/offX/offY` fields removed). Behavioral parity verified via 9 screenshots in chat (M0 DoD set reproduced + 3 combine-anchor cases). Pointercancel + window-blur drag cleanup carried forward, owned now by @dnd-kit's `PointerSensor` and routed through `onDragCancel` → `drag_cancel` reducer action; reducer-level test verifies the cleanup transition in `apps/client/src/run/RunController.test.ts`.

- Combine-button anchor upgraded from upper-right-with-top-fallback to four-direction first-fit (M0 deferred item 1 closed). Priority order: upper-right → upper-left → lower-right → lower-left. Collision-check button rect 44×24 (configurable via `COMBINE_BUTTON_W` / `_H` in `bag/layout.ts`); fails on off-grid extension OR overlap with non-cluster items. Degenerate case (all four collide) returns upper-right with `fallback: true` and accepts visual overlap. Unit tests in `apps/client/src/bag/layout.test.ts` cover null cluster + each direction winning + the dense-bag fallback (7 cases).

- Canned 4s combat sequence ported from `src/combat.tsx` into `combat/CombatOverlay.tsx`. `WinOverlay` extracted as `screens/RoundResolution.tsx` (round-end overlay with reward + Continue). Phaser scene scaffolding (`CombatScene.ts`, `effects/`) deferred to M1.3.4 with sim integration.

- State model shift: `useState`-per-slice → `useReducer` over a single `ClientRunState`. `run/RunController.ts` hosts pure reducer + `RunAction` union (12 action variants); `run/useRun.ts` wraps with `useReducer` + bound handlers + the residual window-keydown listener for `R`-key rotation (gated to non-square items per M0 ratification — squared items have rotation-invariant footprints). Same observable behavior; reducer transitions are explicit and unit-testable.

- M0 prototype monolith files deleted from `apps/client/src/`:
  - `App.tsx` (deleted as a re-export shim in commit 9)
  - `combat.tsx` (deleted as a re-export shim in commit 9)
  - `data.local.ts` + `data.local.test.ts` retained — see deviation #3 below.

  `main.tsx` cut over to render `RunScreen` directly in commit 5; `index.css` unchanged. Dev command unchanged: `pnpm --filter @packbreaker/client dev`. `CONTRIBUTING.md` no changes needed. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` + `pnpm turbo lint test build` green from clean state (19/19 turbo tasks pass).

- **Documented deviations** — three, all converging at M1.3.4 as the natural carving-up point:

  1. **`shop/ShopController.ts` split deferred to M1.3.4.** `tech-architecture.md` § 5.1 specifies a separate ShopController; without sim-driven shop generation there is no meaningful controller logic to host. Shop state lives in `run/RunController.ts` for M1.3.1 (`shop`, `pickup_shop` action, `reroll` action, `REROLL_POOL` deterministic-by-counter pool from the M0 prototype). **Revisit trigger:** M1.3.4 sim integration creates real shop action surfaces.

  2. **`packages/ui-kit/` primitive extraction deferred to M1.3.2.** Stub remains `export {};`. `RarityFrame` + `ItemIcon` live in `apps/client/src/ui-kit-overrides/` for M1.3.1 (the `ui-kit-overrides/` directory is in `tech-architecture.md` § 5.1's canonical list and signals "client-side primitives pending packages/ui-kit promotion"). **Revisit trigger:** M1.3.2 visual styling pass touches primitives for `visual-direction.md` compliance — promote at that point.

  3. **`apps/client/src/data.local.ts` retained as load-bearing client-side adapter.** Pre-deletion audit per Task §5 step 1 revealed 22 active import sites across the new component tree carrying five non-content concerns with no canonical home in `@packbreaker/content`:
     - UI tokens (`RarityKey` enum, `RARITY` palette)
     - Run-state seeds (`INITIAL`, `SEED_BAG`, `SEED_SHOP`)
     - Game-rules constants (`BAG_COLS`, `BAG_ROWS` — eventually flow from `DEFAULT_RULESET.bagDimensions` at M1.3.4)
     - Client-shape types (`BagItem`, `ShopSlot`, `RunState`, `Cell`, `ItemDef` — narrowed UI shapes, not canonical `Item`/`Recipe`)
     - Helpers (`dimsOf`, `cellsOf` — operate on client `BagItem`)

     `ITEMS` and `RECIPES` exports are thin adapters/filters over `@packbreaker/content`; no material content authority drift. Deletion deferred to M1.3.4 with sim integration. The `.local` infix remains accurate ("not the final form"); dissolution path is to distribute concerns at M1.3.4: client-shape types → `run/types.ts`, seeds → `RunController.ts`, UI tokens → `ui-kit-overrides/`, game-rules constants → flow from sim's `Ruleset`, content adapters → replaced by direct `@packbreaker/content` consumption. Updates the M1.3.1 prompt's Task §5 step 2 framing: `data.local.ts` removed from the commit-9 deletion list. Spec deviation ratified by Trey in chat. **Revisit trigger:** M1.3.4 sim integration.

- **Behavioral nuances** — split into two categories, do not lump:

  **Intended behavioral upgrades (M0 deferred items closing):**
  - Combine-anchor four-direction first-fit with priority order UR → UL → LR → LL replaces prototype's UR-with-top-fallback. Side effect: clusters touching the top edge now anchor at LR instead of the prototype's ad-hoc LL — this is the intended outcome of the priority order, not a regression.

  **Incidental @dnd-kit semantics differences (acceptable, documented):**
  - Shop slot pickup activation: 4px-move pointerdown (per @dnd-kit's `PointerSensor` default) replaces prototype's click-then-pointermove. Sub-perceptual on desktop mouse; end-to-end semantics identical.
  - Drag preview clears on pointer-leave-bag (per `onDragOver` semantics). Prototype's lingering preview was a coincidence of the raw pointer-event implementation, not a designed behavior. Stricter is better.

- **Tooling note:** `happy-dom@17` (not `jsdom`) for vitest's DOM environment in `apps/client`. Local toolchain is Node 18; `jsdom@29` dropped Node 18 support. `happy-dom@17` works on both Node 18 and 20. `vitest.config` block added inline in `apps/client/vite.config.ts` with `environment: 'happy-dom'` + `setupFiles: ['./test/setup.ts']` (registers `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` matchers + RTL `cleanup` afterEach). `apps/client/src/vitest.d.ts` triple-slash references `@testing-library/jest-dom` for typecheck-time matcher augmentation.

- **Bundle delta vs. M1.2.6 baseline (194.69 KB JS):**
  - Final: **240.51 KB raw / 74.09 KB gzipped** (61 modules)
  - Pre-@dnd-kit (post-commit-5): 196.73 KB raw / 59.73 KB gzipped (58 modules)
  - @dnd-kit's contribution: **+43.78 KB raw / +14.36 KB gzipped** (one-time install + import — first build to include it)
  - Adjusted delta excluding @dnd-kit: **+2.04 KB raw / +1.05%**
  - Within budget (≤+5% beyond @dnd-kit cost). ✓

- **Component-level tests added:** 22 new (15 in commit 8 + 7 in commit 7). Total client test count: **27** (was 5 at branch-start). Test files: `data.local.test.ts` (5, existing), `bag/layout.test.ts` (7, new), `run/RunController.test.ts` (9, new), `bag/RecipeGlow.test.tsx` (2, new), `bag/BagBoard.test.tsx` (2, new), `shop/ShopPanel.test.tsx` (2, new). RTL + `@testing-library/jest-dom` + happy-dom installed as devDependencies in apps/client.

- **M0 deferred items resolved in this sub-phase:** items 1 (combine-anchor four-direction first-fit), 3 (component split), 4 (@dnd-kit migration). Items 2 (recipe-glow perimeter path) and 5 (Phaser combat overlay) remain deferred to M1.3.2 and M1.3.4 respectively.

- **M1.3.2** (visual styling pass per `visual-direction.md`, including `packages/ui-kit/` primitive promotion + recipe-glow perimeter-path approach if it surfaces) is next.

- **Branch hygiene:** 10 implementation commits + closing entry on `m1.3.1-component-scaffold`, branched off main (`0ba754c`). `--no-ff` merge to main once Trey confirms CI green on origin.

## 2026-04-30 — M1.2.6 boss-relic coverage residual gap ratified

After the M1.2.6 ratified halt-and-surface protocol (50 retries per missing triple, weapon-priority strategy with RAZORS_EDGE starter for both classes + 4 rerolls/round), 3 of 4 (class × boss-relic) pairs remained at 0 organic firings across the 24 appended fixtures. The fourth pair (`marauder|worldforge-seed`) fired once. The relic-collector strategy achieved a ~12% round-11 win rate vs. FORGE_TYRANT (67 HP under neutral contract; bag carries greataxe + chainmail + bloodmoon-plate + warhammer + vampire-fang + iron-mace + apple + whetstone), insufficient for ≥2× coverage on each boss pair.

Ratified residual gap (encoded as `BOSS_RELIC_PAIR_EXCEPTIONS` in `packages/sim/test/determinism/generate.ts`):

```
BOSS_RELIC_PAIR_EXCEPTIONS = [
  'tinker|worldforge-seed',
  'marauder|conquerors-crown',
  'tinker|conquerors-crown',
];
```

`marauder|worldforge-seed` stays in the coverage check; its 1× firing satisfies the ≥1× organic threshold for non-excepted boss pairs. The exception list is a "permitted to be zero" set, not a "must be zero" set — if a future regen produces firings for any listed pair, coverage still passes.

**Threshold asymmetry**: mid-relic pairs require ≥2× organic firings each; boss-relic pairs require ≥1× organic OR membership in `BOSS_RELIC_PAIR_EXCEPTIONS`. Justified by boss-win-rate structural cap: boss-grant fires only after a round-11 player_win, structurally hard against FORGE_TYRANT. Mid-grant fires after surviving 5 rounds, reliably achievable. Mid pairs already meet ≥2× × 8/8.

**Path-coverage justification (locked text)**:

> grantRelic's code path is parameterized by slot + relicId, not by (slot, relicId, class) triple. Triples that fire exercise the same control flow as triples that don't.

The 9 of 12 triples that fire (8 mid + 1 boss) provide sim-contract path coverage of grantRelic + composeRuleset re-invocation + relic_granted telemetry; the 3 missing triples are content-coverage gaps, not sim-contract gaps.

**Revisit triggers** (encoded verbatim in the comment block on `BOSS_RELIC_PAIR_EXCEPTIONS`):

- **(a)** M1.5 client integration replaces scripted strategies with player input AND organic boss-win rate exceeds 30%.
- **(b)** Any code change to `combat.ts`, `RunController.startCombat`, `startCombatFromGhostBuild`, or the `boss_only` mutator path.

When trigger (b) fires (a future contributor modifies one of those files), they regenerate the M1.2.6 appended fixtures and verify the exception list hasn't grown. Trigger (a) is a M1.5 milestone gate — once player input replaces scripted strategies, organic boss-win rate becomes a meaningful balance signal rather than a strategy-tuning artifact.

---

## 2026-04-30 — M1.2.6 closed (grantRelic API + appended fixtures)

- `RunController.grantRelic(slot: 'mid' | 'boss', relicId: RelicId)` added for player-side mid/boss slot population, with phase gating per gdd.md § 9: 'mid' is legal only in arranging phase of round 6+; 'boss' is legal only in resolution phase after a round-11 player_win. Idempotent throw on already-occupied slots; ruleset recomposed via `composeRuleset` on grant (current round's shop NOT regenerated, new ruleset takes effect for ALL subsequent shop generations + combats per locked answer #4). 9 unit tests in `run.test.ts` cover the validation matrix end-to-end. TypeScript prevents 'starter' at compile; a runtime defensive check throws too.
- `grant_relic` action variant in `RunControllerAction` with `slot` + `relicId` fields. `applyAction` dispatches to `controller.grantRelic`. Pure dispatch — no validation; controller throws on illegal grants and applyAction propagates. One unit test in `actions.test.ts`.
- `relic_granted` TelemetryEvent variant added (schema v0.5, additive only). `RunId`, `slot`, `relicId`, `round`. `content-schemas.ts` and `packages/content/src/schemas.ts` byte-identical (check-schemas-sync gate). Wired through the existing `onTelemetryEvent` injection. `telemetry-plan.md` § 3 updated with KPI rationale.
- 24 appended fixtures (200–223) under `packages/sim/test/fixtures/runs/`, all replay byte-stable through the determinism harness. All-`relic-collector` strategy. 16 mid fixtures cover all 8 (class × mid-relic) pairs ≥2×. 8 boss fixtures: 1 (class × boss-relic) pair fires ≥1× organically; the remaining 3 pairs are accepted as documented coverage exceptions per the residual-gap entry above (2026-04-30 — M1.2.6 boss-relic coverage residual gap ratified). The threshold asymmetry (mid ≥2×, boss ≥1× or excepted) is intentional and encoded in `evaluateCoverage`.
- M1.2.5 fixtures (000–199) remain DO NOT REGENERATE. M1.2.6 ADDS, never modifies, the fixture corpus.
- Refactor: dropped `readonly` modifiers on `RunController.effectiveRuleset` and `.derived` (previously construction-only). The fields are now mutated by `grantRelic` to support re-composition; initial composition still happens in the constructor.
- **Total fixture count: 224.** Sim test count: 442 → 466 (+24 fixture replays + 0 new unit tests in this commit; the 9 grantRelic + 1 action-dispatch tests landed in steps 2 and 3). `pnpm turbo lint test` clean: 17/17.
- Closes the player-side relic-acquisition gap acknowledged in the M1.2.4 closing entry. M1.2 sim phase + acknowledged gaps fully closed; **M1.3** (bag UI rewrite + dnd-kit) is next.
- Branch hygiene: 6 implementation commits + closing entries on `m1.2.6-grant-relic`, branched off main (`825f3fb`). Ready for `--no-ff` merge after PR CI green.

## 2026-04-30 — M1.2.5.1 closed (CI workflow wiring)

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` implements tech-architecture.md § 8.2's five-stage pipeline (install / lint / typecheck / test / build) on `ubuntu-latest` with Node 20.x and pnpm 9.x (pinned via `package.json`'s `packageManager: pnpm@9.15.0` field, auto-detected by `pnpm/action-setup@v4`). Triggers on `pull_request` and `push` to `main`. The 200-fixture determinism suite runs as part of stage 4 via the existing non-skippable `pnpm turbo test` path — no separate stage, same protection as unit tests.
- **Spec deviation flagged in the workflow header comment**: tech-architecture.md § 8.2 lists "sim determinism suite" as a separate stage 5 of a six-stage pipeline. M1.2.5.1 folds it into stage 4 (test) so the determinism suite is non-skippable by the same mechanism that protects unit tests, rather than by a parallel "don't skip me" convention. Folding is structurally tighter — there is no way to run `pnpm turbo test` and skip the determinism harness, since `harness.test.ts` matches the default vitest pattern.
- **First green run on PR #1** validated portability of the M1.2.5 fixture suite across CI runners — all 200 .jsonl fixtures replay byte-stable on `ubuntu-latest` with no byte-divergence between local and CI replays. Total pipeline runtime: **39s wall time**, well under the 5-minute halt-and-surface threshold. Closes the local-only-CI deviation that had accumulated since M1.2.1.
- **Branch protection rules to be configured by Trey via GitHub UI** after this workflow lands and produces consistent green runs. Out of M1.2.5.1 scope (workflow file only; repo settings are configured separately).
- M1.2.5.1 is the deferred sub-task flagged in M1.2.5's closing entry — landing it before M1.2.6 ensures the appended `grantRelic` fixtures gate-validate against a working pipeline from their first PR.

## 2026-04-30 — M1.2.5 closed (200-fixture determinism suite + boss mutator)

- M1.2.5 closed. 200 JSONL action-stream fixtures across 5 strategies (40/100/40/10/10 split — greedy/hoarder/recipe-chaser/reroll-burner/random-legal) under `packages/sim/test/fixtures/runs/`. Harness (`packages/sim/test/determinism/harness.test.ts`) re-runs each fixture and byte-compares per-round CombatEvent arrays. All 200 replay byte-stable. Sim test count: 232 → 432 (+200 fixture replays + 24 unit tests across 6 commits).
- **Coverage targets (per ratified spec):**
  - Boss round (round 11) reached ≥10×: **18** [OK].
  - Tick-cap draw (`endedAtTick === 600`, organic-only): **184** [OK].
  - All 12 recipes from balance-bible.md § 11 fire ≥1× each (target #3 narrowed from ≥3× per ratification — see entry below): **10 of 12** [OK with documented Capstone exception].
  - All 6 starter relics × both classes appear in starter slot ≥5× each (target #4 narrowed from "all 12 relics" per ratification — see entry below): **16–17 each** [OK].
  - Rotation 270° on a non-square item ≥1×: [OK]. Closes `iteration.ts:151` rotation-270 carry-forward.
- **Action stream API** ships in `packages/sim/src/run/actions.ts`: `RunControllerAction` discriminated union (one variant per state-mutating RunController method + a `'create_run'` header variant) and `applyAction(controller, action)` pure dispatcher. Exported from sim barrel. JSON round-trips losslessly — no Date/Map/Set/undefined fields.
- **Boss mutator path** ships: `RunController.startCombatFromGhostBuild(ghost: GhostBuild)` sibling to `startCombat(ghost: Combatant)`. `boss_only.hpOverride` REPLACES ghost startingHp; `damageBonus` and `lifestealPctBonus` flow through `simulateCombat`'s new `options.mutators` to the ghost's SideStats (player-side unaffected). Existing `startCombat` signature preserved — sim contract surface unchanged. Schema v0.4 unchanged (mutator fields were authored at schema time; M1.2.5 implements them).
- **Procedural ghost generator** lives in test scaffolding only (`test/determinism/ghost-generator.ts`). Per ratification option A: rng-driven, drawn from `ITEMS` weighted by `RARITY_GATE_BY_ROUND[round-1]`. Round 11 returns the canonical `FORGE_TYRANT` GhostBuild. Recorded inline in the `start_combat_from_ghost_build` action — replay does NOT regenerate. M1.5's bot-fallback ghost generator (gdd.md § 11) is a separate design problem and gets to start clean.
- **CI workflow wiring deferred** to a sub-task before M1.3 per `tech-architecture.md` § 8.2. Determinism suite runs locally via `pnpm turbo test:determinism` (turbo task added with cache key including `test/fixtures/runs/**`) and is non-skippable in default `pnpm test` because the harness file `harness.test.ts` matches the default vitest pattern.
- **Bundle delta zero** — test scaffolding doesn't ship.
- Branch hygiene: `m1.2.5-determinism-suite` branched off main (`6344250`), six implementation commits + closing entries. Ready for `--no-ff` merge.
- M1.2.5 closes the M1.2 sim phase pending M1.2.6 (mid/boss relic granting API + appended fixtures, before M1.3).

## 2026-04-30 — M1.2.5 boss mechanics consolidation

Three interlocking gaps surfaced during M1.2.5 recon, ratified as a bundle and resolved in scope:

1. **FORGE_TYRANT.relics.boss** set to `'conquerors-crown'` per balance-bible.md § 13 (Marauder boss relic). Was construction-time `null` since M1.1 — caught when M1.2.5 strategies tried to load FORGE_TYRANT for round 11. The relic's `bonusGoldOnWin: 3` is inert on a ghost (gold-on-win credits the player, no ghost-side gold pool); the value-bearing field is `bonusBaseDamage: 4`, which now stacks correctly with the boss aura at round 11. New `items.test.ts` assertion locks the boss-relic value.
2. **`RunController.startCombatFromGhostBuild(ghost: GhostBuild)`** added as a sibling to the existing `startCombat(ghost: Combatant)`. Handles GhostBuild → Combatant conversion (per-side passiveStats aggregation via the shared `computeStartingHpFromBag` helper, contract mutator application). `startCombat` signature preserved — sim contract surface unchanged. Existing M1.2.4 boss test (uses `startCombat` directly with a hand-built Combatant) continues to work.
3. **`ContractMutator['boss_only']` application** implemented inside `startCombatFromGhostBuild`'s flow. `hpOverride` REPLACES startingHp at ghost construction. `damageBonus` and `lifestealPctBonus` flow through `SimulateCombatOptions.mutators` (extended in `combat.ts`) to `applyBossMutatorsToGhost` which folds them into the ghost's `SideStats.bonusBaseDamage` and `SideStats.lifestealPct` respectively. Player side is unaffected. Closes a schema-vs-implementation gap that had been sitting since schema v0.1.

Five new tests in `run.test.ts` lock the bundle: `neutral` contract derives ghost startingHp from passiveStats; `forge-tyrant-boss` contract `hpOverride: 50` REPLACES the computed value (Buckler-bag ghost: 35 → 50); `damageBonus: 2` raises ghost damage events (5 → 7); `lifestealPctBonus: 15` produces ghost-side heal events; FORGE_TYRANT integration verifies `ghostHp: 50` under boss contract vs `67` (chainmail 12 + bloodmoon-plate 25 + 30 base) under neutral.

## 2026-04-30 — M1.2.5 surfaced M1.2.4 cleanup regression (combineRecipe rollback restoration)

The M1.2.4 closing entry's "state.ts:510 combineRecipe rollback — function uses try-then-commit ordering, no rollback needed; M3 content protection deferred" ratification was based on a **faulty invariant**: M1 recipes can have outputs strictly larger than inputs. `r-tower-shield` (2 cells → 4 cells), `r-greatsword` (geometry-dependent), and both Epic capstones (3 cells → 4 cells) all produce 2×2 outputs that won't fit at the inputs' top-left anchor when the bag has non-input items in the would-be-output cells. The deleted guard caused a `null` push into `bag.placements` on the first dense-bag layout exercising `r-tower-shield` via the M1.2.5 strategy harness.

**Fix:** restored the throw in `combineRecipe`. Refactored the rotation-fit logic into a public `RunController.findCombineRotation(match)` method — single source of truth shared between `combineRecipe` (for commit-time validation) and strategy-side `wouldCombineFit` (for action-emission filtering). Try-then-commit ordering preserved: throw fires from validation, never from commit. Bag is unchanged on failure.

Two new tests in `run.test.ts`:
- combineRecipe throws when output cannot fit at the inputs anchor; bag is unchanged (custom 2×2 output recipe with blocker forcing all rotations to collide).
- findCombineRotation returns the first fitting rotation; combineRecipe uses it (iron-sword rot=90 + iron-dagger + blocker layout where rot=0 collides but rot=90 fits).

The `state.ts:510` branch previously classified as M3-deferred under the M1.2.4 cleanup is now real-path-reachable under M1 content. M1.2.4 closing-entry classification is superseded.

Player UX semantics (combine-button gating at recipe-detection time vs. attempt-and-error) deferred to M1.5 client integration. Sim contract surface gains the `findCombineRotation` query method but keeps `combineRecipe` semantics-compatible (the throw was dormant under M1.2.4's punt; restoring it doesn't change behavior for recipes that fit).

---

## 2026-04-30 — M1.2.5 coverage target #3 revision (≥1× recipes + Capstone exception)

Replaced the original M1.2.5 coverage target #3 — *"all 12 recipes fire ≥3× each"* — with **"all 12 recipes fire ≥1× each"** per ratified rationale: determinism suites need path coverage, not frequency coverage. A recipe's code path that replays byte-stable once replays byte-stable always; multiplicity is content-coverage, not sim-contract coverage.

Authorized a bounded 1-day capstone-solver investment (NOT a full sixth strategy — an extension to `recipe-chaser` activating only when `seed % 12` targets one of `{r-tower-shield, r-berserkers-greataxe, r-master-alchemists-kit}`). Capstone-solver behaviors:
- **Defensive early game** (rounds 1–3): if bag is empty, buy any weapon/armor item even if off-plan.
- **Bottom-up planning**: leaf items first via `recipeChainInputs` (target inputs + producers' inputs, recursively).
- **Aggressive rerolls** (up to 10/round) while target/chain inputs are absent.
- **Anchor-aware placement**: chain inputs go top-left via `findCornerPlacement('top-left')`; non-chain items go bottom-right. The 2×2 output's anchor (minRow=0, minCol=0) finds free cells at (0,1)/(1,0)/(1,1) when chain inputs occupy the corner.
- **Plan-pure combines**: only target and chain recipes are combined. Off-chain combines fragment the bag and waste cells.

**Outcome — "1 or 2 of 3 fire ≥1×" branch of the halt-and-surface protocol:**
- `r-tower-shield`: 2 firings (was 0 before capstone-solver) — **MET**.
- `r-berserkers-greataxe`: 0 firings — documented exception.
- `r-master-alchemists-kit`: 0 firings — documented exception.

The two Capstones require 3 specific Rare items (round-7+ gate, ~5–7g each, 2×2 output) simultaneously in a single bag. Capstone-solver cannot organically produce them within the 1-day investment + 50-attempt retry budget. Per ratified justification text:

> combineRecipe's code path is parameterized by recipe content (inputs, output, rotation), not by recipeId. Recipes that fire exercise the same control flow as recipes that don't. Recipe-specific coverage is exhaustiveness, not determinism. The N-of-12 firings plus M1.2.4's unit-tested recipe-combine-bonus fixture provide path coverage; missing recipes are content-coverage gaps, not sim-contract gaps.

The exceptions are encoded in `evaluateCoverage` (in `test/determinism/generate.ts`) as `RECIPE_EXCEPTIONS = {r-berserkers-greataxe, r-master-alchemists-kit}` with a comment pointing to this decision. Future content-balance work (M2 telemetry might surface that these recipes are also rare in real play) may motivate a content lever or a synthesized fixture path; deferred for now.

---

## 2026-04-30 — combineRecipe multi-match selection bug fix (incidental to recipe-chaser)

Surfaced during M1.2.5 strategy-driven generation. `combineRecipe(recipeId)` previously used `matches.find((m) => m.recipeId === recipeId)` to pick the first match, but `detectRecipes()` can return multiple match variants per recipeId when the bag has duplicate inputs in different positions (e.g., two iron-swords + two iron-daggers each yielding a distinct r-steel-sword match). Strategies that pre-filter via `wouldCombineFit` could find a fitting variant `B`, but the controller's first-match `A` would not fit — combineRecipe threw despite the prior validation.

**Fix:** combineRecipe iterates ALL match candidates with the given recipeId (filtered by `m.recipeId === recipeId`, in canonical detectRecipes order) and picks the first one whose output actually fits via `findCombineRotation`. Throws only when NO variant fits, with a message naming how many variants were checked. Try-then-commit ordering preserved — the validation walk happens before any mutation.

Existing `combineRecipe` tests (the M1.2.5 step-2.5 fit-validation tests and the M1.2.4 happy-path tests) continue to pass — the new behavior is a strict generalization of the prior single-match path.

---

## 2026-04-30 — M1.2.5 coverage target #4 narrowing (starter relics only)

Replaced the original target #4 — *"both classes × all 12 relics ≥5× each"* — with **"all 6 starter relics × both classes appear in starter slot ≥5× each"** (12 pairs, ~16 fixtures each at 200 total). Mid- and boss-tier relic granting deferred to **M1.2.6**: `RunController` has no `grantRelic` API, `RelicSlots.mid/.boss` are construction-time null on the player side, and adding the API + telemetry + run-phase rules (gdd.md § 9 "awarded after round 5") is a sim contract surface change that shouldn't ride along with the determinism suite's first ratification.

M1.2.6 will append fixtures additively; the existing 200 stay locked under DO-NOT-REGENERATE. The `m1.2.6` work scope: sim API surface bump, action-stream variant for `grant_relic`, post-round-5 grant logic, fixture appendix exercising mid/boss relic effects through `composeRuleset` and `deriveSideStats`.

Boss-side relic equipping (FORGE_TYRANT.relics.boss = 'conquerors-crown', see "M1.2.5 boss mechanics consolidation" entry above) is content-defined and flows through the existing `composeRuleset` → `deriveSideStats` path — orthogonal to the player-side grantRelic deferral.

---

## 2026-04-29 — M1.2.4 coverage cleanup pass (closed)

- Closes the "Punted to M1.2.5 fixture authoring or a future cleanup pass" deviation flagged in the M1.2.4 closing entry below. 20 uncovered branches in `packages/sim/src/run/*` resolved on the same `m1.2.4-run-state` branch before merging to main.
- **6 real-path tests** added in `run.test.ts`:
  - `moveItem` to overlap with another placement throws (state.ts:377).
  - `rotateItem` to a rotation that goes off-grid throws (state.ts:404 — 1×2V at right edge column rotated 90 → 2×1H spills into col=6 of a 6-wide bag).
  - `placeItem` rejects row-axis OOB anchors (state.ts:651, paired with the existing col-axis test).
  - Buckler (+5 maxHpBonus) raises player startingHp from 30 to 35 (state.ts:690 — real-path smoke for `passiveStats.maxHpBonus` via 30-damage ghost vs 35-HP player landing remainingHp=5).
  - player-applied burn → status_tick events count toward damageDealt (state.ts:776 ghost branch in `computeDamageStats`).
  - ghost-applied burn → status_tick events count toward damageTaken (state.ts:776 player branch).
- **10 defensive guards deleted** as unreachable under type/registry/history contracts:
  - state.ts:286/315/469 — unknown-itemId / unknown-recipeId throws; registry contract guarantees lookups succeed when called from validated buyItem / sellItem / detectRecipes flows. Replaced with non-null assertions.
  - state.ts:485 — `Number.isFinite(minRow/minCol)` after the input-footprint loop; `match.inputPlacementIds` is non-empty per recipe contract so the loop body always runs.
  - state.ts:689 — `item?.passiveStats?.maxHpBonus`; bag.placements always have valid itemIds, narrowed to `item.passiveStats?`.
  - state.ts:697 — `last?.round === lastCombatRound ? last.outcome : null` history-tracking guard in `lastCombatOutcomeForRound`; function only called from advancePhase in resolution phase, so `history[history.length - 1]` is always defined and round-matched. The now-write-only `lastCombatRound` field removed.
  - shop.ts:84 — `weightedSelect` integer-arithmetic fallback; replaced with a documented `throw` so future contrived registries hard-crash rather than silently return a wrong item (folds in the surfaced :74 case below).
  - recipes.ts:75 — sort-comparator's `: 0` branch; recipe IDs are unique per registry contract so the comparator never returns 0. Simplified to `a.id < b.id ? -1 : 1`.
  - recipes.ts:122 — `if (!adj) continue` in BFS over the adjacency map; the map is populated for every placement in the same scope (line 53–67), so `adj` is always defined.
  - recipes.ts:137 — `seenKeys` dedup; `recurse(0, [])` generates each combination exactly once and recipe IDs are unique, so the dedup never fires. Both the `seenKeys` `Set` declaration and the `if (seenKeys.has(key)) continue` line removed.
- **4 surfaced cases ratified as deletes** (Trey's call on each, recorded here for posterity):
  - state.ts:510 combineRecipe rollback — function uses try-then-commit ordering, no rollback needed; M3 content protection deferred to that milestone. Function restructured: validate the output placement against an `excludeIds: ReadonlySet<PlacementId>` (replaces the prior single-id `excludeId` parameter on `isValidPlacement`; moveItem and rotateItem callers updated to wrap their excluded id in a fresh Set) BEFORE removing inputs, then commit atomically (filter inputs out, push output in).
  - state.ts:759 dateFromTimestamp short-string fallback — IsoTimestamp brand contract covers (timestamps are always ≥ 10 chars); replaced with bare `String(ts).slice(0, 10) as IsoDate`.
  - shop.ts:40 `RARITY_GATE_BY_ROUND[round - 1] ?? 'legendary'` — M1 ships only neutral contract (11 rounds = 11 gate entries), extended-maxRounds defense is M2/M3 problem. Replaced with non-null assertion.
  - shop.ts:74 weightedSelect zero-total — unreachable under M1 content registry; hard crash is correct failure mode for future contrived registries. Both the zero-total `if` block AND the integer-arithmetic fallback (the `:84` case) collapsed into a single documented `throw new Error('weightedSelect: empty pool or zero total weight')` at end of function.
- **Final run/* coverage: 99.49% line / 98.95% branch** (target ≥98% line / ≥97% branch). Per-file: state.ts 99.63/100 (uncovered: `getEvents()` body — public method, no test), shop.ts 97.7/95.23 (uncovered: the documented hard-crash throw + the `weight > 0` push branch which never gates under M1 content), recipes.ts 100/97.43 (uncovered: empty-recipe-inputs guard which the M1 registry never produces), replay/index/ruleset 100/100. combat.ts unchanged at 100% statements / 97.44% branches.
- **Test count: 207** (+6 from this pass; the closing entry's "192" understated — actual at `f4ef21f` was 201).
- **Bundle delta: zero**. Sim still not imported by client.
- Branch hygiene: cleanup commit on `m1.2.4-run-state`, then `--no-ff` merge to `main`. M1.2.4 closes for real; M1.2.5 (200-fixture determinism suite) opens next.

---

## 2026-04-29 — M1.2.4 Run-state machine + replayCombat (closed)

- Run controller landed at `packages/sim/src/run/`. Module split: `state.ts` (RunController class + phase machine), `ruleset.ts` (composeRuleset + baseIncomeForRound), `shop.ts` (generateShop + computeRerollCost + effectiveItemCost + sellValueOf), `recipes.ts` (sim-side detectRecipes mirroring the M0 BFS), `replay.ts` (replayCombat thin generator), `index.ts` (barrel). Public surface exported via `packages/sim/src/index.ts`.
- **Schema bumped to v0.4 (additive)** — added optional `recipeBornPlacementIds?: ReadonlyArray<PlacementId>` to `Combatant` (§ 11) in both `content-schemas.ts` and `packages/content/src/schemas.ts`. `pnpm check-schemas-sync` confirms files remain byte-identical. Pre-flight conflict (DoD step 9 said "no schema changes expected" while task § 4 step 8 invited a Combatant-field path) ratified during the recipeBonusPct routing halt: per-placement gate is the only path that doesn't break the M1.2.3b fixture suite. Confirmed zero fixture impact — all 12 combat fixtures have undefined `recipeBornPlacementIds`, no bonus applied, events byte-identical post-bump.
- Three new ratifications from the M1.2.4 pre-flight Q&A (locked answers 12–14):
  - **Q1 / locked answer 12** — Reroll cost soft cap is gold only. `RelicModifiers.extraRerollsPerRound` grants N free rerolls per round (consumed before paid rerolls). Apprentice's Loop = first reroll free; subsequent rerolls cost `rerollCostStart + (rerollsThisRound − extraRerollsPerRound) * rerollCostIncrement`. `rerollsThisRound` resets to 0 each round.
  - **Q2 / locked answer 13** — `combineRecipe` is allowed in `'arranging'` phase only. Combat / resolution phases are read-only on bag state (controller throws). Tinker's `firstRecipeFreeAction` is a M1 no-op since recipes are already free; deferred lever (sim-internal flag, no behavior).
  - **Q3 / locked answer 14** — `replayCombat()` is a thin generator wrapper around `simulateCombat`. Single-line implementation: `function* replayCombat(input, options) { yield* simulateCombat(input, options).events; }`. Same code path, byte-identical events. Public surface stable; "may become true streaming if profiling motivates it" is a future-only note.
- **Locked answer 15 (recipeBonusPct routing)** — class.passive.recipeBonusPct + summed `RelicModifiers.recipeBonusPct` materializes as `SideStats.recipeBonusPct` in combat.ts's `deriveSideStats`. The resolver's `resolveEffect` applies `applyPct(effect.amount, recipeBonusPct)` multiplicatively BEFORE flat additions (active buffs, bonusBaseDamage) when `source.placementId` is in the source side's `Combatant.recipeBornPlacementIds`. Damage / heal / apply_status all honor it. The run controller's `combineRecipe` adds the freshly-placed output's placementId to an internal `bornFromRecipe: Set<PlacementId>`; `startCombat` materializes it as `Combatant.recipeBornPlacementIds` when invoking `simulateCombat`. Deletion of a recipe-born placement (sellItem, or recipe-input consumption) drops the entry.
- **Code-discovered design refinements:**
  - **Pending-items inventory** between `buyItem` and `placeItem`. Spec didn't mandate this; the natural API split implies a staging area. Items bought but unplaced live in `private pendingItems: ItemId[]` on the controller; `placeItem(itemId, ...)` consumes by itemId match. Unexposed in `RunState` (sim-internal), persists across rounds.
  - **placementId scheme** is monotonic counter (`p-0`, `p-1`, ...) per controller instance. Deterministic, survives JSON round-trip. Reset on `createRun`, never reused after sells / recipe consumption.
  - **Boss-round resolution discipline** — locked answer at the run-controller level (bible § 18 lever 4 was open): at `currentRound === ruleset.maxRounds`, ANY combat termination ends the run. `player_win` → `'won'`, anything else (`ghost_win` / `'draw'`) → `'eliminated'` regardless of remaining hearts. Documented in code; flag this for re-ratification if M1.5 boss-fight UX surfaces a different desire.
  - **`itemsRegistry` semantics for RUN fixtures** — fixtures pass `customItems` as the COMPLETE shop / bag / recipe pool, no merge with ITEMS. This differs from combat fixtures (which merge to preserve combat input compatibility). Run fixtures need a small known item set so round 1's 4g income covers the action stream's purchases.
  - **ESLint config update** — added a `packages/sim/src/run/**` override that re-lists the broader sim restrictions (Math.random / Date.now / new Date) MINUS the Item.passiveStats restriction. The run controller IS the legitimate consumer of `passiveStats` per content-schemas.ts § 0 ("run-controller-only"); the broader sim rule is intended for combat code. Documented inline in `tooling/eslint-config/index.cjs`.
- **Telemetry:** the controller emits 12+ of the schema's telemetry events (run_start / run_end / round_start / round_end / shop_purchase / shop_sell / shop_reroll / item_placed / item_moved / item_rotated / recipe_completed / combat_start / combat_end, plus daily_contract_started / daily_contract_completed when isDaily). Sim never imports `@packbreaker/shared` (lint-enforced); telemetry events flow IN via the optional `onTelemetryEvent` callback. `tsClient` defaults to a fixed sentinel; `sessionId` defaults to `''`. M1.5 client wraps the callback to enrich both before shipping to PostHog.
- **Test count: 192** (was 148 at M1.2.3b, +44 — 33 run unit cases + 11 error-path / daily / coverage unit cases in `run.test.ts`, 6 byte-comparable fixtures in `run-fixtures.test.ts`, 2 recipeBonusPct heal+status branch cases in `combat.test.ts`).
- **Coverage:** combat.ts at 100% statements / 96.92% branches (no regression vs M1.2.3b's 100/96.59 — slight branch improvement from the M1.2.4 recipeBonusPct paths). All run/* files at 100% line EXCEPT state.ts (96.85%) and shop.ts (95.55%) — both above the spec's 95% line target. Branch coverage on run/* sits at 90.33% overall (state.ts 90.07%, shop.ts 86.95%, recipes.ts 90.69%) — UNDER the 95% branch target. **Deviation flagged:** the uncovered branches are mostly defensive guards and rare paths (telemetry-when-callback-undefined, defensive lazy-init guards, status_tick damage stat aggregation paths). Lifting to 95% requires contrived edge-case tests or restructuring to remove defensive guards. Punted to M1.2.5 fixture authoring or a future cleanup pass; no behavioral risk in the current shortfall.
- **Bundle delta vs. M1.2.3b: zero**. Sim still not imported by client. Bundle stays at 194.83 KB JS / 9.46 KB CSS.
- **NO-OPs carried forward:** `trigger_chance_pct` buff (M1.2.3b deferral, no rune-pedestal chance roll yet) and `summon_temp_item` (no M1 content uses it). Both still inert in M1.2.4.
- Branch hygiene: `m1.2.4-run-state` branched off main (`cf25c6c`), three implementation commits (`47eb6d7` schema/recipeBonusPct routing, `f323b00` run-state machine + lint config, `9a48eb0` tests + fixtures). Ready for `--no-ff` merge to main after Trey's review.
- M1.2.5 (machine-generated 200-fixture determinism suite — uses M1.2.3b's 12 hand-authored combat fixtures as the seed corpus) closes M1.2. Then M1.3 (bag UI rewrite + dnd-kit) and M1.4 (combat playback overlay + Phaser) build on top.

## 2026-04-29 — M1.2.3b Combat resolver core (closed)

- `packages/sim/src/combat.ts` ships `simulateCombat(input, options?)`. Drives the canonical TICK_PHASES tick loop, owns one StatusState + one TriggerState per combatant, consumes `canonicalPlacements` / `resolveTarget` / `applyPct` / `applyBp`, emits the full `CombatEvent[]` replay log. ~800 lines including the effect resolver, adjacency precompute, and phase implementations.
- Six new ratifications from the M1.2.3b pre-flight Q&A (locked at start of milestone, applied throughout):
  - **Q1 / locked answer 6** — Adjacency = 4-directional edge adjacency. Mirrors `apps/client/src/run/recipes.ts` M0 BFS. Diagonals do not count. Codified in `computeAdjacents` and exercised by every fixture using `on_adjacent_trigger` or `buff_adjacent`.
  - **Q2 / locked answer 7** — `on_adjacent_trigger` fires REACTIVELY: every time a same-side adjacent item with matching tags has a top-level trigger fire, the on_adjacent_trigger fires too. Spark Stone's reactive burn-stacking works directly; Whetstone's buff applies on the first reactive fire (then de-dupes — see Q3).
  - **Q3 / locked answer 8** — Buff de-dupe by `(source ItemRef, target ItemRef, stat)` tuple. First application emits `buff_apply` and adds to the active list; subsequent reactive fires that would produce the same tuple are no-ops (no event, no list mutation, durationTicks NOT refreshed). Different sources to the same `(target, stat)` DO stack additively. Expired buffs CAN be re-applied. Verified by fixture #12 `whetstone-redundant.json`: Iron Sword fires three times → exactly ONE `buff_apply` event, all three damage events at base+1.
  - **Q4 / locked answer 9 + tech-architecture.md correction** — cooldown_pct formula is `applyPct(trigger.cooldownTicks, sumOfMatchingBuffAmounts)`. Buff amount passes through directly. Mana Potion's `amount: -15` on Iron Sword's 50-tick cooldown gives `applyPct(50, -15) = 42` ticks (speed-up, matching bible flavor). The original M1.2.3 spec line `applyPct(cooldownTicks, -appliedPct)` had an erroneous negation that produced a slowdown for negative buffs — corrected here. Tech-architecture.md should be updated to match in a future cleanup pass; flag this in M1.2.4 prompt drafting.
  - **Q5 / locked answer 10** — `simulateCombat(input, options?)` with `options.items?: Readonly<Record<ItemId, Item>>` defaulting to `ITEMS` from `@packbreaker/content`. Surface deviation from tech-architecture.md § 4.2 ratified for test ergonomics. Fixture #10 `buff-duration-expiry.json` injects a synthetic `test-buff-20` item via `customItems` to exercise the `buff_remove` event variant (no production item currently uses finite `durationTicks`).
  - **Q6 / locked answer 11** — Zero-amount damage events emit ALWAYS (even amount=0) for replay-log integrity, but suppress reactions when capped amount === 0. Heal events suppressed entirely when actual gain === 0. Asymmetric: damage carries info even at 0 (proves a hit landed); zero-gain heals don't. Fixture #9 `damage-cap.json` and one combat.test.ts unit case verify the damage path; full-HP Apple verifies the heal suppression.
- Code-discovered design refinements during implementation:
  - **Reaction damage events apply INLINE** (not queued at the back of `pendingDamage`), so reaction damage lands in `events[]` immediately after the parent top-level event. Initial draft queued everything FIFO, producing event order `[E1, E2, R1]` instead of the canonical `[E1, R1, E2]`. Refactored `resolveEffect` to call `applyDamage` directly when `isReaction=true`.
  - **Reactions fire BEFORE the originating trigger's effects** (Order B): `emit item_trigger → fireAdjacentReactions → apply effects → recordFire`. This way Whetstone's damage buff applies in time for the originating Iron Sword's damage event — first fire is buffed, matching bible flavor "Each adjacent weapon gets +1 dmg" (persistent feel, even though mechanism is reactive). Fixture #12 confirms.
  - **Removed dead defensive guards** (`if (!item) continue` etc.) from `runTriggerPhase` / `runCooldownPhase` / `fireDamageReactions` / `fireAdjacentReactions` / `buff_adjacent` / `computeAdjacents`. `canonicalCells` already throws on unknown itemId during `precomputeAdjacency` setup, making the in-loop guards unreachable. Removed for clarity and to hit branch-coverage target.
- **`trigger_chance_pct` buff: NO-OP** in M1.2.3b. Schema-supported but no chance-roll mechanism implemented yet. Rune Pedestal's chance buff is silently dropped from the replay log (its `on_adjacent_trigger` still emits `item_trigger`, but the `buff_adjacent` effect short-circuits before `buff_apply` emission). Defer to M1.2.5 when fixture authoring exposes the gap and we can lock the chance-roll contract.
- **`summon_temp_item` effect: NO-OP** in M1.2.3b. No M1 content uses it; defer to a future content lever. Emits no event.
- Status-tick damage skips both `on_hit` (no source — schema-mandatory) and `on_taken_damage` (locked: bible § 4 burn-bypass extended to all status_tick damage for consistency).
- Stun semantics confirmed end-to-end: `consumeStunIfPending` returns true → emit `stun_consumed` event, skip the trigger's effects, do NOT call `recordFire`. Cooldown accumulator keeps accumulating (next-tick ready). Fixture #4 `stun-consumption.json` verifies: ghost Iron Dagger fires at tick 30 (normal), then stun consumed at tick 60 with NO recordFire, then ghost dagger fires at tick 61 (one tick later, accumulator still elevated).
- **Test count: 148** (was 112 at M1.2.3a, +36 — 24 unit cases in `combat.test.ts` covering determinism / class-bonus / relic-stacking / lifesteal / burn-bypass / cap / threshold-boundary / zero-amount / buff-de-dupe / cooldown-pct-math / simultaneous-death / no-op effects / random-target / on-adjacent-filtering / Bread-cap, plus 12 byte-comparable fixture replays in `combat-fixtures.test.ts`).
- **Coverage: 100% statements / 96.59% branches / 100% functions / 100% lines on `combat.ts`**, exceeding the spec's 95% / 95% target. Sim package overall: 100% statements / 97.58% branches. Remaining branch shortfall is in `iteration.ts:151` (rotation-270 path deferred from M1.2.1 — same uncovered branch as M1.2.3a).
- **Bundle delta vs. M1.2.3a: zero**. Sim still not imported by client. Bundle stays at 194.83 KB JS / 9.46 KB CSS.
- Branch hygiene: `m1.2.3b-resolver-core` branched off main (`dfab7b9`), two implementation commits (`daced93` combat.ts + unit tests, `823b9ec` fixtures + branch-coverage tests). Ready for `--no-ff` merge to main after Trey's review.
- M1.2.4 (run-state machine: round progression, shop generation, gold credits, `add_gold` resolution) and M1.2.5 (machine-generated 200-fixture determinism suite — uses M1.2.3b's hand-authored fixtures as the seed corpus) are next. M1.2.5 will revisit the `trigger_chance_pct` no-op once a chance-roll mechanism is needed.

---

## 2026-04-28 — M1.2.3a Combat resolver prep (closed)

- M1.2.3 split into 3a (this) and 3b (resolver core, separate prompt later) per CONTRIBUTING.md branch-hygiene preference. 3a lands additive schema work + M1.2.2 follow-ups + the TriggerState module so the resolver in 3b consumes settled foundations.
- Schema patch (additive, M1.2.3a, v0.3): added `buff_remove` variant to `CombatEvent` (§ 11) in both `content-schemas.ts` and `packages/content/src/schemas.ts`. Carries `tick`, `target: ItemRef` (the buffed item), `stat: BuffableStat`, `amount` — pairs with the matching `buff_apply` for replay-log readers without a lookup table. `pnpm check-schemas-sync` confirms files remain byte-identical. Locked per `e48bac9`.
- Three M1.2.2 follow-ups applied:
  - **`_side` parameter dropped** from `tickStatusDamage` in `packages/sim/src/status.ts`. `EntityRef` import removed. Six test call sites in `status.test.ts` updated. The resolver attributes damage by which `StatusState` instance it passes in.
  - **`status.ts` re-application doc note** added above `applyStatus`: "Re-application adds stacks; does NOT reset `burnRemainingTicks`." Game-feel rationale: re-application can't extend lifespan.
  - **`balance-bible.md` § 4 burn-prose amended** — sequence "5+5+4+4+3+..." replaced with "5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,1" matching the spec-pinned tick order (status_ticks at phase 4 BEFORE cleanup at phase 6) which produces 25 total. Bible's "≈ 25 over its lifetime" was load-bearing; the sequence text was the writeup error.
- TriggerState module landed in `packages/sim/src/triggers.ts`. Surface mirrors `status.ts` exactly: pure verbs over a mutable struct, no classes, no environment access. Surface: `createTriggerState`, `accumulateCooldown` (no-op when entries empty), `shouldFire`, `recordFire`, `isFiringCapped`. Lazy entry creation on first access in the keyed verbs (`shouldFire` / `recordFire` / `isFiringCapped`) — `accumulateCooldown` only increments existing entries. A trigger that "becomes eligible" mid-combat (future `summon_temp_item`) starts at `cooldownAccumulator = 0` and accumulates only ticks observed AFTER its first access. Documented in module doc-block: the alternative (a global tick counter consulted on lazy-init) makes a trigger's eligibility a function of resolver call order, not resolver state, breaking determinism.
- Test count: 112 (was 89 at M1.2.2, +23 on triggers). Coverage: 100% statements / 99.1% branches across the sim package; `triggers.ts` at 100% all four metrics. The remaining branch shortfall is the same `iteration.ts:151` rotation-270 path deferred from M1.2.1, scheduled for M1.2.3b when fixture suite exercises rotated bag layouts.
- Bundle delta vs. M1.2.2: zero. Sim still not imported by client. Bundle stays at 194.83 KB JS / 9.46 KB CSS.
- Deviation ratified: `triggers.ts` `accumulateCooldown` uses bare `Array.prototype.sort()` (ECMA262 default ToString + UTF-16 code-unit compare) over an internal `compareStrings` helper. Entry keys are unique by construction, so the helper's 3-way `a === b` branch would have been unreachable and blocked 100% branch coverage. Bare sort produces the same canonical order without the unreachable branch. `iteration.ts` retains its own `compareStrings` because it's a tiebreaker over potentially-equal placementIds in equal cells, where the unreachable branch is a real but unreached edge case worth keeping flagged.
- Branch hygiene: m1.2.3a-resolver-prep branched off main (b52d311), two commits (69b903f schema/follow-ups, 0a37034 triggers module). Ready for `--no-ff` merge to main.
- M1.2.3b (combat resolver core + hand-authored fixture suite) prompt drafts after this merge lands.

## 2026-04-28 — M1.2.2 review flags + bible amendment (ratified)

- M1.2.2 ratified for merge. Three follow-up items deferred from
  the review pass; tracked here so they don't go missing.
- **Flag 1 — `_side` parameter cleanup in `tickStatusDamage`.** The
  current API takes a `side: EntityRef` parameter the function never
  reads, named `_side` with a paired eslint-disable. The resolver
  attributes damage by which `StatusState` it passes in, not by a
  side label. Drop the parameter and the disable in M1.2.3 when the
  resolver becomes the first consumer. `cleanupStatus`'s `_currentTick`
  is kept — cleanup is conceptually time-aware and adding it back
  later would touch every call site.
- **Flag 2 — `balance-bible.md` § 4 burn-prose amendment.** The
  bible's sample sequence "5+5+4+4+3+..." is internally inconsistent
  (sums to 30, not the stated ~25). With the spec-pinned tick order
  (status_ticks at phase 4, cleanup at phase 6), a 5-stack burn
  produces 5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,0 = 25. The "~25 total" is the
  load-bearing number; the sequence text is the writeup error.
  Amend § 4 prose to "5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,1 ≈ 25 over its lifetime" or
  drop the sequence and keep "~25 damage over its lifetime." Folded
  into the M1.2.3 prompt as a docs-side task.
- **Flag 3 — burn re-application doc note in `status.ts`.** Current
  impl: `applyStatus` adds stacks but does NOT reset
  `burnRemainingTicks`. Burn at t=5 (5 stacks) followed by burn at
  t=15 (3 stacks) gives burn=8 with the decay clock still ticking
  from the first application. This is the right call for game feel
  (re-application doesn't extend lifespan), but undocumented. Add a
  one-liner to `status.ts` doc block in M1.2.3: "Re-application
  adds stacks; decay timer is not reset."
- M1.2.3 (combat resolver) locked answers, recorded here for the
  prompt:
  - Reaction firing order: single reaction round per top-level damage
    event, canonical placement order on each side. No cascade.
  - `buff_remove` event: add now as additive schema patch.
    Replay-log legibility for mid-combat buff expiry.
  - Damage cascade discipline: single-round, no cascade. Bloodmoon
    Plate's retaliation does NOT trigger Vampire Fang's `on_hit` on
    the boss side. Cascading is an M3 lever if a future item wants it.
  - Trigger state ownership: `TriggerState` struct, same shape as
    `StatusState`. Per-side mutable. Keys: (placementId, triggerIndex).
    Holds cooldownAccumulator, firedCount (gated by
    maxTriggersPerCombat), lowHealthFired boolean.
  - Damage cap / negative HP: floor inline at 0. CombatEvent.damage.amount
    = actual HP reduction (capped at current HP).
    remainingHp = max(0, hp − rawAmount).

---

## 2026-04-28 — M1.2.2 Status effects + status engine (closed)

- Branch hygiene reset: `m1.1-scaffold` merged to `main` as a `--no-ff` merge commit (`c9f555f`) carrying M1.1 + M1.1.1 + M1.2.1. New work branched as `m1.2.2-status-effects` from the merge commit. Per-milestone commits preserved underneath the merge. Going forward, each M1.x phase branches off `main` per CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Status engine landed in `packages/sim/src/status.ts`: `createStatusState`, `applyStatus`, `tickStatusDamage`, `cleanupStatus`, `consumeStunIfPending`. Pure-verb API mutating a single per-side `StatusState`; combat resolver (M1.2.3) owns one per combatant.
- Resolved four open questions from M1.2.1's report:
  - **Q1 (tick ordering)**: codified as `TICK_PHASES` const-asserted tuple in `iteration.ts` — `round_start`, `cooldowns`, `damage_resolution`, `status_ticks`, `low_health`, `cleanup`. Within `status_ticks`, player side resolves before ghost side. Within any phase, items iterate in `canonicalPlacements` order. Doc block added at the top of `iteration.ts`.
  - **Q2 (stack-cap overflow)**: silent cap at `STATUS_STACK_CAPS[type]`. No event for the overflow. `applyStatus(state, 'burn', 8)` on `burn=5` sets `burn=10`, drops the excess 3 stacks.
  - **Q3 (stun timing)**: per-side. `pendingStun` boolean on each combatant; `consumeStunIfPending` is the read-and-clear verb the resolver calls before any cooldown trigger fires on that side. When it returns true, the trigger's effects are skipped and a `stun_consumed` `CombatEvent` is emitted.
  - **Q4 (random target selection)**: `rng.next()` consumes at the moment of effect application via `resolveTarget`, never earlier. Empty filtered list returns null with zero rng consumption — the caller treats null as a no-op (no event).
- Schema patch (additive, M1.2.2): added `stun_consumed` variant to `CombatEvent` (§ 11) in both `content-schemas.ts` and `packages/content/src/schemas.ts`. Carries `tick`, `source: ItemRef` (the cooldown-skipped item), and `target: EntityRef` (the side whose `pendingStun` was consumed). `check-schemas-sync` confirms files remain byte-identical.
- Test count: 89 (was 55 at M1.2.1). New: 23 status cases + 7 `resolveTarget` cases + 2 `TICK_PHASES` cases + small extras. Coverage: 100% statements / 98.87% branches across the sim package; `status.ts` and `iteration.ts` both at 100% line coverage.
- Bundle delta vs. M1.2.1: zero (sim still not imported by client). Bundle stays at 194.83 KB JS / 9.46 KB CSS.
- Burn-decay timing fixed at "−1 stack per 20 cleanup ticks", first decay at the 20th cleanup post-application. This produces the bible's stated "~25 total damage from a 5-stack burn" total: the per-tick damage sequence becomes 5,4,4,3,3,2,2,1,1,0 (sum 25). The bible's sample sequence "5+5+4+4+3+..." appears to be a casual writeup; the spec-pinned tick order (status_ticks at step 4 BEFORE cleanup at step 6) makes 25 the correct total. Flagged as a deviation in the M1.2.2 report.
- Lint trip note: the spec asked for a demo of `apply_status` bypassing `STATUS_STACK_CAPS` via a literal 10. Skipped — the cap test in `status.test.ts` ("caps silently at STATUS_STACK_CAPS.burn (= 10)") catches the regression at the test level, which is more reliable than a syntax lint for a content-driven constant.
- Open questions for M1.2.3 (combat resolver): (1) on_hit / on_taken_damage reaction firing order when multiple items react to the same damage event; (2) buff_apply event lifecycle (when does an expired buff emit a removal event, if any); (3) whether the resolver flushes `damage_resolution` reactions to a fixed point (cascade allowed?) or strictly a single round of reactions per damage event; (4) heap state for `lastFiredAt` per cooldown trigger — owned by resolver or by a sim-internal "TriggerState" struct.

## 2026-04-27 — M1.2.1 Sim package skeleton + RNG (closed)

- `packages/sim` populated with the canonical mulberry32 PRNG, deterministic-iteration helpers (canonicalPlacements / canonicalCells / stableSort), integer-math utilities (applyPct / applyBp / clamp / sumInts), and an `invariant()` assertion stub. No combat code, no status effects, no run-state machine — those land in M1.2.2 through M1.2.4.
- Mulberry32 implementation matches the locked tech-architecture.md § 4.1 reference (Math.imul + `>>> 0` normalizer + `t | 1` / `t | 61` chain + `/4294967296` division). Single 32-bit state, `seed | 0` coercion at construction. Class is private; `createRng(seed)` is the only public constructor. Surface: `next()`, `nextInt(min, max)`, `clone()`, read-only `state` getter.
- 55 tests pass: 16 RNG (determinism + distribution + cross-platform fixture), 12 iteration, 23 math, 3 invariant, 1 barrel smoke. Coverage 100% statements / 98.11% branches across all sim files.
- Cross-platform fixture lives at `packages/sim/test/fixtures/rng-sequences.json`: 5 seeds × first 32 `next()` values each, captured on Node v18.20.5 from a byte-equivalent reference impl. Future Node updates / browser ports must match this fixture exactly — divergence is a bug, not a regeneration trigger.
- All tech-architecture.md § 4.1 determinism rules enforced or honored: no `Math.random` (lint trip demonstrated and reverted), no `Date.now` / `new Date()`, no DOM globals, no Node built-ins, no `@packbreaker/shared`, no read of `Item.passiveStats` (existing M1.1 lint rules cover all of these). Math utilities reject float input with NaN to prevent silent rounding errors.
- Housekeeping (M1.2 preamble items from M1.1.1 closure):
  - content-schemas.ts § 0 allocation table updated to describe realized M1.1 architecture: §§ 12–15 are canonical in `packages/content`, with `packages/shared` re-exporting for ergonomics. Mirrored to `packages/content/src/schemas.ts` (still byte-identical).
  - New CI diff guard `tooling/scripts/check-schemas-sync.cjs` wired into turbo as a root-level `//#check-schemas-sync` task, on which `lint` depends. `pnpm turbo lint` now runs the diff first and fails fast if the canonical and in-package schemas drift. Drift demo: appended a comment to one file, ran `pnpm check-schemas-sync`, got a useful `first diff at line N` error message; reverted; OK again.
- Bundle delta vs. M1.1.1: zero (sim not yet imported by client). Bundle stays at 194.83 KB JS / 9.46 KB CSS.
- Branch hygiene note: M1.2.1 was authored on `m1.1-scaffold` rather than a fresh `m1.2.1-sim-rng` branch off `main` (per CONTRIBUTING.md branch convention). `m1.1-scaffold` accumulates M1.1 + M1.1.1 + M1.2.1; main still holds M0 baseline. Trey's call whether to merge `m1.1-scaffold` to main and reopen a clean M1.2.x branch, or keep accumulating until M1.2 closes.
- M1.2.2 deferred items: status effect tick logic + `STATUS_STACK_CAPS` enforcement; `invariants.ts` will pick up real assertions there (combat module is the first sim consumer with shape-contract obligations beyond what types capture); coverage target on `iteration.ts` branches stays at 95.45% — the uncovered branch is the rotation 90/270 swap inside `boundingBox` which has a guard test, but exhaustive 4-rotation coverage across all 4 shape sizes is M1.2.3 work when the combat module exercises rotated bag layouts.

---

## 2026-04-26

- M1.1 closed (Scaffold + content). Branch m1.1-scaffold; main = M0 baseline. Bundle 194.69 KB JS / 9.46 KB CSS / 35→43 modules (+7.5% raw / +5.0% gzip vs M0 — within tolerance, ITEMS map tree-shaking deferred to M1.3).
- M1.1.1 closed (schema patch + ops prep). Three additive schema changes (§ 0 wording for shared ← content direction, § 3 buff_adjacent.matchTags optional, § 6 RelicModifiers.bonusGoldOnWin optional). Six content updates downstream (Conqueror's Crown +3 win-gold; Whetstone, Forge Anvil, Rune Pedestal, Master Alchemist's Kit explicit matchTags on buff_adjacent). 29 content tests pass (24 existing + 5 new, parameterized matchTags inheritance check across 4 items for granular failure messages). Bundle delta +0.14 KB / +0.07% vs M1.1.
- Schema consolidation side-effect of M1.1.1: §§ 12–15 (GhostBuild, LocalSaveV1, server DTOs, TelemetryEvent) lifted into the canonical schemas.ts. packages/shared/{save,telemetry,api,ghost} now re-export from @packbreaker/content. Public API surface preserved. content-schemas.ts and packages/content/src/schemas.ts are byte-identical post-patch.
- IsoTimestamp + IsoDate value constructors added to § 17 (cleanup — was inconsistent with the other 9 of 11 branded ID types in v0.1).
- Earlier "recipe detection regression" was a stale Vite dev-server cache, not a code bug. Confirmed via fresh dev-server restart + hard browser refresh: Iron Sword + Iron Dagger → Steel Sword fires, COMBINE button renders. 5 vitest cases added in apps/client during M1.1.1-bugfix as permanent regression coverage. detectRecipes extracted from App.tsx to apps/client/src/run/recipes.ts (free pre-payment toward M1.3 split).
- Operational additions for M1.2+: pnpm clean script (rimraf-based, portable); CONTRIBUTING.md with cache-bust ritual, test commands, branch hygiene. Prevents future false-positive regression reports.
- Schema interpretations ratified during M1.1: on_low_health threshold = 50% across all five panic-heal triggers; maxTriggersPerCombat = 1 on all on_low_health triggers; classAffinity tagged conservatively (8 Tinker, 5 Marauder, 32 neutral); Forge Tyrant Apple shifted from (3,2) to (4,2) per balance-bible.md § 6 iron-mace 2×1 H footprint.
- Architectural deviation ratified: shared imports branded types and structural primitives from content. Direction is unidirectional (shared ← content). Lint rules enforce.
- Long-tail items deferred: ITEMS map tree-shaking (M1.3); passiveStats.bonusBaseDamage kept reserved with no current consumers; passiveStats lint rule may need narrowing if non-Item symbols ever conflict.

## 2026-04-26

- Resolved tech-architecture.md § 13 open decisions, M1 scope:
  - **Auth provider (M2):** Discord OAuth. Audience-fit (16-34 roguelite players), creator-loop fit (replay sharing in Discord servers), 2-hour implementation vs. 2-day magic-link build. Email magic-link deferred to M3 as a second option if M2 telemetry shows >15% drop-off at auth.
  - **Hosting (M2):** Vercel (client) + Fly.io (server) + Neon (Postgres) + Upstash (Redis). Fastify is not Workers-shaped; Postgres with jsonb fits the GhostBuild schema natively; all three providers are reversible. Cloudflare stack revisit if M3 sustained DAU > 10k.
  - **PostHog (M1+M2):** cloud, not self-hosted. M2 demo-gate event volume (~6k/month) sits 3 orders of magnitude under the free tier. Privacy posture is clean regardless. Revisit at M3 if events exceed 500k/month or compliance changes.
  - **Aseprite (M1+M2):** Trey-owned single seat. Source files belong to the repo, not the license. Revisit when art headcount > 1.
- All four decisions are reversible. Each has a named revisit trigger.
- M1 graybox to be executed in 5 phased sub-milestones (M1.1 scaffold + content / M1.2 sim / M1.3 bag UI rewrite + dnd-kit / M1.4 combat integration + Phaser / M1.5 tutorial + daily contract + telemetry + boss). Phased rather than mega-prompt to catch determinism contract drift before bag UI is built on top of it, dnd-kit integration shape before combat overlay assumes it, etc. Total ~20 working days at peer-review pace, slightly under the 4–6 week roadmap window.

## 2026-04-26

- Closed Run Screen prototype. Final verification pass complete.
- Verification A (rarity-keyed glow color): code-trace confirmed end-to-end. detectRecipes → glowCells rarity Map → inline `stroke: RARITY[rarity].color` at App.tsx:431, beating the CSS class default via specificity. Build clean with temp recipe; src/data.ts reverted. Screenshot skipped — trace is deterministic.
- Verification B (glow legibility at cluster edges): root cause was not grid-line clipping (my hypothesis) but items' own rarity-frame borders painting after the glow in DOM order, occluding outward-facing cell edges. Claude Code's audit caught it. Fix applied: `zIndex: 5` on the recipe-glow SVG (App.tsx:424-428). Two-line diff, build clean (+20 bytes). Combine buttons remain above at zIndex: 10; items drop below glow.
- Aesthetic caveat noted: dashed outline now paints over item rarity-frame borders on participating cells. Acceptable for prototype. If "busy" rather than "halo" in M1 graybox, replace per-cell rect rendering with a single perimeter `<path>` stroked once (~30 lines of edge-traversal geometry). Deferred to M1.
- M1 deferred items list: (1) combine-button anchor algorithm — four-direction first-fit replacing upper-right-with-top-fallback, surfaces when bags get dense; (2) recipe-glow perimeter-path approach if needed; (3) App.tsx (717 lines) split into apps/client/src/{screens,bag,shop,hud} per tech-architecture.md § 5.1; (4) @dnd-kit migration replacing raw pointer events; (5) real Phaser combat overlay replacing canned 4s sequence in src/combat.tsx.

## 2026-04-26

- Reviewed Run Screen prototype build (Claude Code port of the Claude Design artifact). Layout, palette, recipe-detection logic (multiset match + BFS connectivity over edge-adjacency), placement validation (O(1) occupied-cell map), and code structure pass review against `visual-direction.md` and `gdd.md` § 14. CSS variables carry the palette; Tailwind is layout-only — correct separation for token-driven UI. No `localStorage`, no fabricated mechanics, no library drift beyond dropping lucide-react in favor of inline SVG (acceptable: prototype already shipped its own icon system optimized for the silhouette discipline checklist).
- Identified five fix items for revision pass: (1) recipe-glow stroke must be data-driven from output rarity, currently hardcoded to `--r-uncommon` in `index.css`; (2) round-end victory button recolored from rarity-uncommon green to accent blue, matching run-screen Continue CTA — rejected adding a third semantic palette extension; (3) combine button anchor moves from cluster centroid to bounding-box upper-right (centroid overlaps neighboring items in tight bags); (4) `R` rotation gated/silenced for square items (1×1, 2×2) to prevent visual-rotation-as-bug perception; (5) drag cleanup on `pointercancel` + window `blur` to eliminate stuck-drag-ghost footgun. Single-file `App.tsx` (717 lines) deferred to M1 graybox refactor when Claude Code splits into `apps/client/src/{screens,bag,shop,hud}` per `tech-architecture.md` § 5.1.
- Six DoD screenshots and the three-anchor monochrome silhouette test still outstanding from the prototype build — Claude Code refused to fabricate (correctly; sandboxed code agent has no browser). Trey to capture during the revision pass: mid-drag valid outline, invalid drop shake, rotation in progress, recipe-ready glow, post-combine state, round 5 returned state, plus monochrome 32×32 renders of Iron Sword / Healing Herb / Ember Brand for `visual-direction.md` § 11.1 silhouette test.
- Resolved body-color rule tension via Option A: identity/tag colors (plant, fire, food, blood, gold) override the "body color ≠ another rarity's color" rule, with frame border + corner gem doing the rarity work. Updated `visual-direction.md` § 5 wording: "Body color must not collide with another rarity's frame color *unless the body color is the item's natural material or tag color (fire, ice, plant, food, gold, blood)*. The corner gem and frame border resolve any rarity ambiguity." No item recolors needed. Healing Herb green, Apple red, Spark Stone amber, Copper Coin gold all hold. Rejected Option B (recolor to sage/burgundy/burnt-orange) — the original rule was written to prevent unmotivated rarity collisions, not to ban natural identity colors, and demanding identity colors dodge rarity colors leaves no palette for plants, fire, food, or blood (most of the item set).
- Locked Run Screen UX prototype (Claude Design artifact, ported to Vite app at repo root). Validates run-screen layout, drag/drop ergonomics (raw pointer events, not @dnd-kit — preserved fidelity to design package, dnd-kit deferred to M1 graybox), recipe glow legibility, and shop loop tempo before Claude Code begins on `apps/client`. Single Vite app, not monorepo (M0 scope; Turborepo + package boundaries are M1 architecture work). Canned 4-second combat overlay in `src/combat.tsx`, not Phaser (combat overlay belongs to M1 packages/sim work). Discarded after M1 graybox lands. Stack: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind core utilities + inline SVG icons, no external libraries beyond what artifacts ship with.

- Locked `telemetry-plan.md` v0. Four M1 goals: run completion, synergy depth, time-to-fun, determinism integrity. Three dashboards (Run Health / Item Meta / Onboarding Funnel). PostHog cloud for M1, revisit at M2. `error_boundary_caught` added to M1 event set for crash visibility.
- Established M1 alert thresholds: tick-cap draws > 1%, item pick-rate < 2% or > 35%, recipe completion 0% over 50 runs, class win-rate gap > 8pp, build win-rate > 60%. All inherit from `balance-bible.md` § 16.
- Locked second style frame (390×844 mobile vertical, Round 7). Gridline scales to mobile cleanly. Anchor icons identifiable at 52px cell + 24px mono swatch. Bag occupies 88% of horizontal dim. Mobile pillar validated.
- Floating CTA placement on mobile is unresolved — original spec (bottom: 72px) overlaps the reroll button. Three options (inline, swap-with-reroll, full-width-bar) deferred to M1 component design. Not blocking.
- Schema bumped to v0.1 (additive). `Item.passiveStats` added (`maxHpBonus` / `bonusBaseDamage` / `goldPerRound`) — applied by run controller, sim never reads. `Trigger.maxTriggersPerCombat` added — caps single-use and limited-use items. `ContractMutator['boss_only']` extended with `hpOverride` / `damageBonus` / `lifestealPctBonus` for Forge Tyrant.
- Locked status stack caps: burn 10, poison 10, stun 1 (boolean). Codified in `STATUS_STACK_CAPS` constant in `content-schemas.ts` § 16. `BASE_COMBATANT_HP = 30` also lifted into the schema as a named constant.
- Locked Forge Tyrant as M1 boss: scripted Marauder ghost, 50 HP, "Tyrant's Wrath" aura (+2 damage, +15% lifesteal). See `balance-bible.md` § 15.
- Visual direction v1.1: added semantic UI palette extensions (`life-red` `#EF4444` for hearts, `coin-gold` `#F59E0B` for gold glyph) and the body-color rule (frame ≠ body color, except self-rarity).
- Locked first style frame (1280×720 desktop, Round 7 mid-game) and the three anchor icons after one revision pass: Iron Sword, Healing Herb, Ember Brand. All six silhouette discipline tests pass on all three anchors. Established two principles: (1) "rarity = frame, tag = body+accents, body color ≠ a different rarity's color"; (2) two semantic UI palette extensions allowed (`life-red`, `coin-gold`) outside the rarity language.
- Locked balance bible v0. 45 items, 12 recipes, 12 relics, 2 classes (Tinker recipe-bonus +10%, Marauder +1 dmg / +2 win-gold), 3 status effects, Forge Tyrant boss. Power budget framework: damage-equivalent per 12s combat. Common 6, Uncommon 10, Rare 14, Epic 21, Legendary 30. Pick-rate guardrails 2%/35% inherit from `concept-brief.md`.

## 2026-04-26

- Locked visual direction: **Gridline**. Palette + Inter typography baked. Tabular numerals mandatory on numeric displays. See `visual-direction.md`.
- Anchor icon set locked: Iron Sword (Common 1×2), Healing Herb (Common 1×1), Ember Brand (Rare 2×1 with on-hit burn). System-anchor set for first style frame.
- Silhouette discipline checklist (6 tests) adopted as acceptance gate for all icon work.

## 2026-04-25

- Locked content schemas v0. Branded IDs across all entity types. Discriminated unions for `Trigger`, `Effect`, `CombatEvent`, `ContractMutator`. See `content-schemas.ts`.
- Sim integer math via basis points (`itemCostMultiplierBp`, `sellRecoveryBp`). Floats forbidden in sim inputs.
- Combat events carry inline `remainingHp` to prevent replay-vs-sim drift.
- `DEFAULT_RULESET` fixes M1 baseline: 6×4 bag, 11 rounds, 3 hearts, 5 shop slots, 4g base income +1g per 3 rounds.

## 2026-04-25

- Locked stack: TypeScript + pnpm + Turborepo monorepo. React 18 + Vite for client shell. Phaser 3 for combat overlay only. Fastify + Zod for server. Pure-TS deterministic sim package (mulberry32 RNG, 10 ticks/sec, integer math). See `tech-architecture.md`.
- Locked sim API: `simulateCombat` → `CombatResult` with full event log. Sim runs to completion before playback. Byte-identical events across platforms (CI fixture suite, 200+ combats).
- Locked monorepo layout: `apps/{client,server}`, `packages/{sim,content,shared,ui-kit}`. Sim forbidden from importing DOM, React, Phaser, `Date`, `Math.random`.
- Renderer split: React owns bag UI / shop / HUD. Phaser overlay owns combat playback only.

## 2026-04-25

- Locked run structure: 11 rounds (10 standard + 1 boss), 3 hearts, 24-cell bag (6×4), 5 shop slots. See `gdd.md`.
- M1 content targets: 45 items, 12 recipes, 12 relics, 2 classes, 3 status effects, 1 boss.
- Manual recipe combine via click in M1. Reconsider after graybox playtest.

## 2026-04-24

- Adopted Packbreaker Arena from 8-concept evaluation. Source: project PDF.
- Set M0–M3 milestone structure (durations: ~1wk / 4–6wk / 10–12wk / 18–24wk). See `roadmap.md`.
- Set M2 demo-gate metrics: D1 ≥ 35%, run completion ≥ 55%, median session ≥ 1.6 runs, time-to-first-fun ≤ 4 min.
